# The Evil Customs of Zahhak and the Device of Irma'il and Karma'il

Zahhak sat on the throne a thousand years

Obeyed by all the world. Through that long time

The customs of the wise were out of vogue,

The lusts of madmen flourished everywhere, f

All virtue was despised, black art esteemed,

Right lost to sight, disaster manifest ;

While divs accomplished their fell purposes

And no man spake of good unless by stealth. I

Two sisters of Jatnshid, their sex's crown,

Were brought out trembling like a willow-leaf.

Of those two ladies visaged like the moon

The names were Shahrinaz and Arnawaz.

Men bore them to the palace of Zahhak

And gave them over to the dragon king,

Who educated them in evil ways

And taught them sorcery and necromancy.

The only teaching that he knew was bad —

To massacre, to pillage, and to burn.

Each night two youths of high or lowly birth

Were taken to the palace by the cook,

Who having slaughtered them took out their brains

To feed the snakes and ease the monarch's anguish.

Now in the realm were two good high-born Persians —

The pious Irma'il and Karma'il

The prescient. Talking of the lawless Shah,

Of his retainers and those hideous meals,

One said :

> By cookery we might approach
>
> The Shah, and by our wits devise a scheme
>
> To rescue one from each pair doomed to death.

They went and learned that art. The clever twain

Became the monarch's cooks and joyed in secret.

The time for shedding blood and taking life

Came, and some murderous minions of the Shah

Dragged to the cooks with violence two youths

And flung them prone. The livers of the cooks

Ached, their eyes filled with blood, their hearts with wrath,

And each glanced at the other as he thought

Of such an outrage by the Shah. They slew

One of the youths and thought it best to mingle

His precious brains with sheep's and spare the other,

To whom they said :

> Make shift to hide thyself,
>
> Approach not any dwelling-place of man,
>
> Thine are the wastes and heights.

A worthless head

Thus fed the serpents, and in every month

The cooks preserved from slaughter thirty youths,

And when the number reached two hundred saved

Provided them, the donors all unknown,

With sheep and goats, and sent them desertward.

Thus sprang the Kurds, who know no settled home,

But dwell in woollen tents and fear not God.

Zahhak was wont, such was his evil nature,

To choose him one among his warriors

And slay him for conspiring with the divs.

Moreover, all the lovely noble maidens

Secluded in their bowers, not tanged of tongues,

He took for handmaids. Not a jot had he

Of faith, king's uses, or morality.
