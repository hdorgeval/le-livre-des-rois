# How the Feast of Sada was Founded

One day he reached a mountain with his men

And saw afar a long swift dusky form

With eyes like pools of blood and jaws whose smoke

Bedimmed the world. Hushang the wary seized

A stone, advanced and hurled it royally.

The world-consuming worm escaped, the stone

Struck on a larger, and they both were shivered.

Sparks issued and the centres flashed. The fire

Came from its stony hiding-place again

When iron knocked. The worldlord offered praise

For such a radiant gift. He made of fire

A cynosure.

> This lustre is divine,

He said,

> and thou if wise must worship it.

That night he made a mighty blaze, he stood

Around it with his men and held the feast

Called Sada; that bright festival remaineth

As his memorial, and may earth see

More royal benefactors like to him.

By Grace and kingly power domesticating

Ox, ass, and sheep he turned them to good use.

> Pair them,

he said,

> use them for toil, enjoy
>
> Their produce and provide therewith your taxes.

He slew the furry rovers for their skins,

Such as the squirrel, ermine, fox, and sable,

So sleek of hair ; the rovers clothed the talkers.

He gave, spent freely, and enjoyed the fruit,

Then passing took naught with him but repute.

In life no little share of toil had he

In musings past all count and grammarye,

And when a better life was his elsewhere

He left the throne of greatness to his heir.

The time that fortune gave him did not last

For long, Hushang, the wise and prudent, passed.

To thee too, this world will not give its love,

Nor will it from its face the veil remove.
