# The Accession of Hushang and his civilising Arts

Hushang, a just and prudent sovereign,

Assumed his grandsire's crown. For forty years

Heaven turned above him. He was just and wise.

He said :

> I lord it o'er the seven climes,
>
> Victorious everywhere. My word is law,
>
> I practise bounteousness and equity ;
>
> So hath God willed.

He civilised the world,

And filled the surface of the earth with justice.

He was the first to deal with minerals

And win the iron from the rock by craft.

He gained more knowledge and, inventing smithing,

Made axes, saws, and mattocks. Next he turned

To irrigation by canals and ducts ;

Grace made the labour short. As knowledge grew

Men sowed and reaped and planted. Each produced

The loaf whereof he ate, and kept his station.

Till then men lived on fruit in poor estate

And clad themselves in leaves. Religious rites

Existed, Gaiumart had worshipped God.

Hushang first showed the fire within the stone,

And thence through all the world its radiance shone.
