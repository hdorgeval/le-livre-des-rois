# The Accession of Hushang and his civilising Arts

Hiishang, a just and prudent sovereign,

Assumed his grandsire's crown. For forty years

Heaven turned above him. He was just and wise.

He said :

> I lord it o'er the seven climes,
>
> Victorious everywhere. My word is law,
>
> I practise bounteousness and equity ;
>
> So hath God willed.

He civilised the world,

And filled the surface of the earth with justice.

He was the first to deal with minerals

And win the iron from the rock by craft.

He gained more knowledge and, inventing smithing,

Made axes, saws, and mattocks. Next he turned

To irrigation by canals and ducts ;

Grace made the labour short. As knowledge grew

Men sowed and reaped and planted. Each produced

The loaf whereof he ate, and kept his station.

Till then men lived on fruit in poor estate

And clad themselves in leaves. Religious rites

Existed, Gaiumart had worshipped God.

Hushang first showed the fire within the stone,

And thence through all the world its radiance shone.

How the Feast of Sada icas Founded

One day he reached a mountain with his men

And saw afar a long swift dusky form

With eyes like pools of blood and jaws whose smoke v. 19

Bedimmed the world. Hushang the wary seized

A stone, advanced and hurled it royally.

The world-consuming worm escaped, the stone

Struck on a larger, and they both were shivered.

Sparks issued and the centres flashed. The fire

Came from its stony hiding-place again

When iron knocked. The worldlord offered praise

For such a radiant gift. He made of fire

A cynosure. " This lustre is divine,"

He said, " and thou if wise must worship it."

That night he made a mighty blaze, he stood

1 Around it with his men and held the feast

Called Sada; that bright festival remaineth

As his memorial, and may earth see

More royal benefactors like to him.

By Grace and kingly power domesticating

Ox, ass, and sheep he turned them to good use.

" Pair them," he said, " use them for toil, enjoy

Their produce, and provide therewith your taxes."

He slew the furry rovers for their skins,

Such as the squirrel, ermine, fox, and sable,

So sleek of hair ; the rovers clothed the talkers.

He gave, spent freely, and enjoyed the fruit,

Then passing took naught with him but repute.

In life no little share of toil had he

In musings past all count and grammarye,

And when a better life was his elsewhere

He left the throne of greatness to his heir.

The time that fortune gave him did not last

For long, Hushang, the wise and prudent, passed.

To thee too this world will not give its love,

Nor will it from its face the veil remove.
