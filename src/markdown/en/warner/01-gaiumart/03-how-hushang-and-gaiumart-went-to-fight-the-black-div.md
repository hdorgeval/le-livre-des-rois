# How Hushang and Gaiumart went to Fight the Black Div

The blessed Siyamak had left a son,

His grandsire's minister, a prince by name

Hushang — a name implying sense and wisdom.

It was the lost restored and fondly cherished,

And therefore being set on war the Shah

Sent for the prince and frankly told him all : —

" I mean to gather troops and raise the war-cry,

But thou being young shalt lead for I am spent." v. 17

He raised a host of fairies, lions, pards,

And raveners, as wolves and fearless tigers,

But took the rear, his grandson led the host.

The Black Div though in terror raised the dust

To heaven, but his claws were hanging slack

Frayed by the roaring beasts. Hushang saw this

And putting forth his hands like lion's paws

Made earth too narrow for the lusty di'v,

Then flayed him, lopping off his monstrous head,

And trampled him in scorn thus flayed and shent.

The days of Gaiumart had reached their close

When he achieved this vengeance on his foes ;

He passed away, the world was for his heir,

But see who hath had glory to compare

With his ! He owned this tricky world and made

The path of gain his path, and yet he stayed

Not to enjoy, for like a story done

Is this world : good and ill abide with none.
