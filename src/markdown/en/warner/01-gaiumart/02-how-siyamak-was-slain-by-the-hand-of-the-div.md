# How Siyamak was Slain by the Hand of the Div

News of that foul div's acts reached Siyamak,

Who listened eagerly ; his heart seethed up

With rage. He gathered troops, arrayed himself

In leopard-skin, for mail was yet unworn,

And went to fight. When host met host he came

In front unarmed to grapple with the son

Of Ahriman. That horrible Black Dfv

Clutched at, bent down that prince of lofty stature

And rent him open. Thus died Siyamak

By that foul hand and left the army chiefless.

When Gaiumart heard this the world turned black

To him, he left his throne, he wailed aloud

And tore his face and body with his nails ;

His cheeks were smirched with blood, his heart was broken,

And life grew sombre. All the soldiers wept,

Consumed upon the flames of woe, and wailed

As clad in turquoise-coloured garb they stood

Before the portal of the Shah. All cheeks

Were wine-red, for all eyes shed tears of blood.

Birds, timid beasts and fierce, flocked to the mountain

With doleful cries in anguish, and dust rose

Before the court-gate of the mighty Shah.

When one year had passed thus the blest Surush

Was sent by God ; he greeted Gaiumart

And said :

> Lament no more, control thyself,

>

> Do as I bid, collect thy troops and turn

>

> Thy foemen into dust, relieve earth's surface

>

> Of that vile div and thine own heart of vengeance.

The famous Shah looked up and cursed his foes,

Then, calling by the highest of all names

Upon his God, he wiped his tears away

And prosecuted vengeance night and day.
