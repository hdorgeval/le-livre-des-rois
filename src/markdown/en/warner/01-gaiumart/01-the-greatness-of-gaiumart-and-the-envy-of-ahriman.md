# The Greatness of Gaiumart and the Envy of Ahriman

What saith the rustic bard ? Who first designed

To gain the crown of power among mankind ?

Who placed the diadem upon his brow ?

The record of those days hath perished now

Unless one, having borne in memory

Tales told by sire to son, declare to thee

Who was the first to use the royal style

And stood the head of all the mighty file.

He who compiled the ancient legendary,

And tales of paladins, saith Gaiumart

Invented crown and throne, and was a Shah.

This order, Grace, and lustre came to earth

When Sol was dominant in Aries

And shone so brightly that the world grew young.

Its lord was Gaiumart, who dwelt at first

Upon a mountain ; thence his throne and fortune

Rose. He and all his troop wore leopard-skins,

And under him the arts of life began,

For food and dress were in their infancy.

He reigned o'er all the earth for thirty years,
In goodness like a sun upon the throne,
And as a full moon o'er a lofty cypress
So shone he from the seat of king of kings.
The cattle and the divers beasts of prey
Grew tame before him ; men stood not erect
Before his throne but bent, as though in prayer,
Awed by the splendour of his high estate,
And thence received their Faith. He had a son
Named Siyamak, ambitious like his sire,
A youth well favoured, skilled, and fortunate,
His father's Life, whose joy was gazing on him,
That fruitful offshoot of the ancient stem.
That Life the father cherished tenderly,
And wept for love, consumed by dread of parting.
Thus time passed onward and the kingdom prospered, â€ž
For Gaiumart had not an enemy 1
Except, in secret, wicked Ahriman, [
Who led by envy sought the upper hand.
He had a son too, like a savage wolf
Grown fearless, and a host of warriors.
The son assembled these and sought his sire,
Resolved to win the great Shah's throne and crown,
Whose fortune joined with that of Siyamak
Made the world black to him. He told his purpose
To every one and filled the world with clamour ;
But who told Gaiumart about the foe ?
The blest Surush appeared in fairy-form,
Bedight with leopard-skin, and told the king
The projects that his foes were harbouring.
