# The Greatness of Gaiumart and the Envy of Ahriman

What saith the rustic bard ? Who first designed

To gain the crown of power among mankind ?

Who placed the diadem upon his brow ?

The record of those days hath perished now

Unless one, having borne in memory

Tales told by sire to son, declare to thee

Who was the first to use the royal style

And stood the head of all the mighty file.

He who compiled the ancient legendary,

And tales of paladins, saith Gaiumart

Invented crown and throne, and was a Shah.

This order, Grace, and lustre came to earth

When Sol was dominant in Aries

And shone so brightly that the world grew young.

Its lord was Gaiumart, who dwelt at first

Upon a mountain ; thence his throne and fortune

Rose. He and all his troop wore leopard-skins,

And under him the arts of life began,

For food and dress were in their infancy.
