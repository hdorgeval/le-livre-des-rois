# The Story of Faridun and the Minister of Zahhak

Zahhak while absent left in charge of all

A man of wealth, who served him like a slave,

So that his master marvelled at his zeal,

One named Kundrav, because he used to limp

Before the unjust king. He came in haste

And saw within the hall a stranger crowned,

Reposing on the throne, in person like

A cypress over which the full moon shineth,

On one side Shahrinaz the cypress-slim,

Upon the other moon-faced Arnawaz.

The city swarmed with soldiers, and a guard

Stood ready armed before the palace-gate.

All undismayed, not asking what it meant,

Kundrav approached with lowly reverence,

Then offered homage, saying :

> Live, king !
>
> While time shall last. Blest be thy sitting here
>
> In Grace, for thou deservest sovereignty.
>
> The seven climes be thine and be thy head
>
> Above the rain-clouds.

Being bid approach

He told the Shah the secrets of his office

And was commanded :

> Serve a royal feast,
>
> Let wine be brought, call minstrels fit to hear,
>
> To cheer me at the banquet, fill the goblet,
>
> Spread out the board, and summon worthy guests.

Kundrav obeyed and brought bright wine and minstrels,

And noble guests whose birth entitled them.

So Faridun quaffed wine and chose the lays

And held that night a worthy festival.

Kundrav at dawn left the new prince in haste

And on a swift steed sought Zahhak. Arrived

He told the things that he had seen and heard :

> king of chiefs ! the token of thy fall
>
> Hath come, three men of noble mien arrived
>
> With troops ; the youngest of the three, in height
>
> A cypress and a king in face, is placed
>
> Between the other two and hath precedence.
>
> His mace is like a mountain-crag and shineth
>
> Amid the host. He entered thine abode
>
> On horseback, and the others rode with him â€”
>
> A noble pair. He went and sat upon
>
> The royal throne and broke thy charms and spells.
>
> As for the divs and warriors in thy palace
>
> He struck their heads off as he rode along
>
> And mingled brains and blood !

Zahhak replied :

> 'Tis well, guests should enjoy themselves.

Kundrav

Retorted :

> One that hath an ox-head mace !
>
> Beware of such in coining and in going ;
>
> Besides, he sitteth boldly on thy couch,
>
> Eraseth from the crown and belt thy name,
>
> And maketh thine ungrateful folk his own :
>
> If such a guest thou knowest know him such.

Zahhak said: " Trouble not, it bodeth well

When guests are at their ease."

Kundrav replied :

> Yea, I have heard so ; hear thou my rejoinder:
>
> If this great man be any guest of thine
>
> What business hath he in thy women's bower ?
>
> He sitteth with the sisters of Jamshld
>
> The worldlord, taking counsel, while this hand
>
> Is toying with the cheek of Shahrin&amp;z
>
> And that with Arnawaz' carnelian lip.
>
> At night he doth still worse and pilloweth
>
> His head on musk ! What musk ? The locks of Moons
>
> Who ever were the idols of thy heart.

Zahhak, wolf-savage, wished that he were dead.

With foul abuse he sternly hoarsely threatened

That luckless one :

> No more shalt thou have charge
>
> Of any house of mine.

Kundrav replied :

> Henceforth, king ! I deem thy fortune shent.
>
> How shouldst thou make me ruler in the city,
>
> Or give me even minstrels' work, when thou
>
> Hast lost the throne of power ? For like a hair
>
> From dough hast thou departed from the throne
>
> Of sovereignty. Think, sire ! what thou wilt do.
>
> Have thine own interests no concern for thee ?
>
> They ne'er before were in such jeopardy.
