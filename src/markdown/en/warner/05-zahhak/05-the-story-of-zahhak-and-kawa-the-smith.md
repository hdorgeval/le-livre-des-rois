# The Story of Zahhak and Kawa the Smith

Zahhak had "Faridun" upon his lips

Both day and night, his lofty stature bent

Beneath the terrors of his heart until

One day, when sitting on the ivory throne

And wearing on his head the turquoise crown,

He called the notables from every province

To firm the bases of his sovereignty,

And said to them :

> Good, wise, illustrious men !
>
> I have, as sages wot, an enemy
>
> Concealed, and I through fear of ill to come
>
> Despise not such though weak. I therefore need
>
> A larger host — men, divs, and fairies too —
>
> And ask your aid, for rumours trouble me ;
>
> So sign me now a scroll to this effect : —
>
> ' Our monarch soweth naught but seeds of good,
>
> He ever speaketh truth and wrongeth none.'

Those upright men both young and old subscribed

Their names upon the Dragon's document,

Against their wills, because they feared the Shah.

Just then was heard outside the palace-gate

The voice of one that clamoured for redress.

They called him in before the Shah and set him

Among the paladins. Zahhak in dudgeon

Said :

> Tell us who hath wronged thee.

Then the man

Smote on his head before the Shah and cried :

> Shah ! my name is Kawa and I sue
>
> For justice. Do me right. I come in haste
>
> Accusing thee in bitterness of soul ;
>
> An act of justice will enhance thy greatness.
>
> I have had many an outrage at thy hands,
>
> For thou hast stabbed my heart unceasingly, '
>
> And if the outrages had not thy sanction
>
> Why hath my son been taken ? I had once
>
> In this world eighteen sons : but one is left !
>
> Have mercy ! Look on me this once ! My liver
>
> Is ever burning ! What is mine offence,
>
> Shah ? Oh, say ! If I have not offended
>
> Seek not occasion 'gainst the innocent,
>
> Regard my plight and save thyself from woe.
>
> My back is bent with length of years, despair
>
> Hath seized my heart, my head is all distraught,
>
> My youth is gone, my children are no more,
>
> And children are the nearest kin on earth.
>
> Oppression hath a middle and an end,
>
> And pretext ever. Tell me what is thine
>
> For wronging me and ruining my life.
>
> A smith am I, an inoffensive man,
>
> Upon whose head the Shah is pouring fire,
>
> And thou a,rt he, and, though of dragon-form,
>
> Must still do justice in this cause of mine.
>
> Since thou dost rule the seven provinces
>
> Why should the toil and hardship all be ours ?
>
> We have accounts to settle — thou and I —
>
> And all will be aghast if they shall show
>
> That this my son hath perished in his turn
>
> With all the rest to feed those snakes of thine.

The monarch listened and was sore amazed.

They set the young man free and strove to win

The father by fair words, but when Zahhak

Bade him subscribe the scroll he read it through

And shouted to the ancients of the realm :

> Confederates of the Div with impious hearts !
>
> Ye set your faces hellward and have yielded
>
> To that man's bidding. I will not subscribe,
>
> Or ever give the Shah another thought.

He shouted, rose in fury, rent the scroll

And trampled it ; then with his noble son

In front of him went raving to the street.

But all the courtiers blessed the Shah and said :

> Illustrious king of earth ! may no cold blast
>
> From heaven pass o'er thee on the day of battle.
>
> Why was this insolent Kawa countenanced
>
> As though a friend of thine ? He tore the scroll,
>
> Refusing to obey thee, and is gone
>
> Bent on revenge and leagued, as thou wouldst say,
>
> With Faridun ! A viler deed than this
>
> We never saw and marvel such should be.

He answered quickly :

> I will tell you wonders.
>
> When Kawa entered and I heard his cries,
>
> A mount of iron seemed to rise betwixt us ;
>
> And when he beat his head a strange sensation
>
> Convulsed me. How 'twill end I cannot tell ;
>
> The secrets of the sky are known to none.

When Kawa left the presence of the Shah,

A crowd assembled in the market-place.

And still he shouted, crying out for aid

And urging all to stand upon their rights.

He took a leathern apron, such as smiths

Wear to protect their legs while at the forge,

Stuck it upon a spear's point and forthwith

Throughout the market dust began to rise.

He passed along with spear in hand exclaiming :

> Ye men of name ! Ye worshippers of God !
>
> Whoe'er would 'scape the fetters of Zahhak
>
> Let him resort with me to Faridiin
>
> ' And shadow in his Grace. Come ye to him ;
>
> The ruler here is Ahriman — God's foe.

^

So that poor leather, worthless as it was, '

Discriminated friends and enemies.

He took the lead, and many valiant men

Resorted to him ; he rebelled and went

To Faridun. When he arrived shouts rose.

He entered the new prince's court, who marked

The apron on the spear and hailed the omen.

He decked the apron with brocade of Rum

Of jewelled patterns on a golden ground,

Placed on the spearpoint a full moon — a token

Portending gloriously — and having draped it

With yellow, red, and violet, he named it

The Kawian flag. Thenceforth when any Shah

Acceded to the throne, and donned the crown,

He hung the worthless apron of the smith

With still more jewels, sumptuous brocade,

And painted silk of Chin. It thus fell out j

That Kawa's standard grew to be a sun

Amid the gloom of night, and cheered all hearts.

Time passed and still the world maintained its secret.

When Faridun saw matters thus, and all men

Submiss to vile Zahhak, he came to Faranak

With girded loins, crowned with a royal casque,

And said :

> I go to battle, but do thou
>
> Devote thyself to prayer. The Maker ruleth.
>
> In weal and woe alike clasp hands to Him.

With tears and bleeding heart she cried :

> God !
>
> My trust hath been in Thee. Turn from my son
>
> The onslaughts of the wicked on his life,
>
> And rid the world of these infatuates.

Then Faridun gat ready with despatch

And secrecy. He had two brothers, both

Of noble birth and older than himself,

Hight Kaianush and prosperous Purmaya.

He said to them :

> Live, gallant hearts ! in joy.
>
> Revolving heaven bringeth naught but good ;
>
> The crown of power is coming back to us.
>
> Provide me cunning smiths and let them make me
>
> A massive mace.

They sought the smiths 1 bazar

In haste, whence all the aspiring craftsmen went

To Faridiin, who taking compasses

Showed to the smiths the pattern, tracing it

Upon the ground. It had a buffalo's head.

They took the work in hand, and having wrought

A massive mace they bore it to the hero.

It shone as brightly as the noonday sun,

And Faridun, approving of the work,

Bestowed upon the makers raiment, gold,

And silver, holding out to them beside

Bright hopes and promise of advancement, saying :

> If I shall lay the Dragon in the dust
>
> I will not leave the dust upon your heads,
>
> But justify the entire world, since I
>
> Have Him in mind who judgeth righteously.
