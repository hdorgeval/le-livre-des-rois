# The Birth of Faridun

Years passed away, calamity approached

The dragon-king, the blessed Faridun

Was born, the fashion of the world was changed.

Of cypress height he shone forth with the Grace

Of kings of kings which erst Jamshid possessed,



Was like the sun, as needful as the rain

To earth and fit as knowledge to the mind ;

Revolving heaven loved him tenderly.

Then lived the cow Birmaya, chief of kine,

Born with a coat all bright and peacock-hued.

The wise, the archmages, and astrologers

Collected round her ; none had seen or heard

Of such a cow before.

Meanwhile Zahhak

Was searching everywhere, and filling earth

With hue and cry, till Faridun became

A source of danger to his sire Abtin,

Who fled for life but to the Lion's toils,

For certain of the followers of Zahhak,

That impious monarch, met Abtin one day,

Seized him and bore him, like a cheetah bound,

Before the Shah, who had him put to death.

When Faridiin's wise mother Faranak,

A glorious dame devoted to her child,

Perceived her husband's evil fate she fled ;

And came heart-broken weeping to the field

Wherein the beautiful Birmaya was.

Still shedding drops of blood she bade the hind :

> Protect this suckling for me, be a father
>
> To him, and give him milk of yon fair cow.
>
> Ask what thou wilt, e'en to my soul 'tis thine.

The hind replied :

> I will perform thy bidding
>
> And be as 'twere a slave before thy child.

Then Faranak resigned the babe to him,

With all instructions that were requisite,

And that wise guardian like a father fed

The child for three years with Birmaya' s milk ;

But as Zahhak ne'er wearied of the search,

And as the cow was talked of everywhere,

The mother hasted to the field again

And spake thus to the guardian of her child :

> A prudent thought — a thought inspired by God —
>
> Hath risen in my heart. What we must do
>
> Is this — there is no remedy, my son
>
> And my dear life are one — I must abandon
>
> This land of sorcerers, depart unmarked
>
> To Hindustan and bear him to Alburz.

Then like a roe or one who rideth post

She took the young child to that lofty mountain

Where dwelt a devotee dead to the world,

To whom she said :

> I am, holy one !
>
> A woeful woman from fran. Know thou
>
> That this my noble son will be hereafter
>
> The leader of his people, will discrown
>
> Zahhak and tread his girdle in the dust.
>
> Take thou this child and father him with care.

The good man took her child and never breathed

One cold breath on him.

When the rumour reached

Zahhak about the cow and field he went,

Like some mad elephant, and slew Birmaya,

With all the other cattle that he saw

Within the field, and harried all the land.

He went next to the home of Faridun,

Searched it, but all in vain, for none was found,

And burned the lofty palace to the ground.
