# How Faridun bound Zahhak

Roused by that talk Zahhak resolved to act,

And bade his keen-eyed roadsters to be saddled.

Now as he neared the city by a byway

With valiant divs and warriors, and saw

His palace-roofs and gate he vowed revenge.

The troops of Farldun received the tidings

And nocked to meet him. Leaping from their steeds

They struggled hand to hand. The citizens,

Such as were warlike, manned the roofs and gates

For Faridun ; Zahhak had maddened them.

Bricks from the walls, stones from the roofs, with swords

And poplar arrows in the street, were plied

As thick as hail ; no place was left to stand.

The mountains echoed with the chieftains' shouts,

Earth trembled neath the chargers' tramping hoofs,

A cloud of black dust gathered, and the flints

Were pierced by javelins. From the Fane of Fire

One shouted :

> If some wild beast had been Shah,
>
> We — young and old — had served him loyally,
>
> But not that foul Zahhak with dragon-shoulders.

The warriors and citizens were blent

Together as they fought — a mass of men.

O'er that bright city rose a cloud of dust

That turned the sun to lapislazuli.

Anon Zahhak alone in jealous fear

Approached the palace, mailed, that none might know him.

Armed with a lasso sixty cubits long

He scaled the lofty edifice in haste

And saw beneath him dark-eyed Shahrinaz,

Who toyed bewitchingly with Faridun.

Her cheeks were like the day, her locks like night,

Her lips were opened to revile Zahhak,

Who recognised therein the act of God —

A clutch of evil not to be evaded —

And with his brain inflamed by jealousy

Dropped one end of the lasso to the court

And so slid down from that high roof, regardless

Of throne and precious life. As he descended

He drew a keen-edged poniard from its sheath,

Told not his purpose or his name, but clutched

The steel-blue dagger in his hand, athirst

For blood — the blood of those two beauteous dames.

His feet no sooner rested on the ground

Then Faridun rushed on him like the wind

And beat his helm in with the ox-head mace.

> Strike not,

cried blest Suriish, who hurried thither,

> His time hath not yet come, but bind him vanquished
>
> Firm as a rock and bear him to some gorge,
>
> Where friends and kinsmen will not come to him.

When Faridun heard that he tarried not,

But gat a lasso made of lion's hide

And bound Zahhak around the arms and waist

With bonds that no huge elephant could snap,

Then sitting on Zahhak's own golden throne

Determined all the evil usages

And made a proclamation at the gate :

> Ye citizens possessed of Grace and wisdom !
>
> Disarm and follow but one path to fame,
>
> For citizens and soldiers may not seek
>
> A common excellence ; this hath his craft
>
> And that his mace ; their spheres are evident
>
> And, if confounded, earth will be so too.
>
> Depart rejoicing, each one to his work,
>
> And live and prosper long, because the foul one,
>
> Whose acts brought terror on the world, is bound.

Men hearkened to the great redoubted Shah.

Then all the leading, wealthy citizens

Drew near with gladness bringing offerings

And heartily accepted Faridun,

Who graciously received them and discreetly

Gave each his rank's due, counselled them at large,

And offered up his prayers and thanks to God,

Then said :

> The realm is mine, your fortune's star
>
> Is bright, for me alone did God send forth
>
> From Mount Alburz by Grace, and for your sakes,
>
> To set the world free from the Dragon's bane.
>
> Blest as we are by Him who giveth good
>
> We ought to walk toward good upon His paths.
>
> As king I may not tarry in one place,
>
> Else would I pass with you a length of days.

The nobles kissed the ground. Anon the din

Of drums rose from the gate whereon all eyes

Were fixed, the people yelled against the man,

Whose days were almost sped :

> Bring forth the Dragon
>
> Bound in the lasso's coils as he deserveth.

The troops withdrew no wealthier than they came,

And took Zahhak, bound shamefully and flung

In wretched plight upon a camel's back

On this wise to Shi'rkhan. Call this world old

Or ever thou shalt hear this story told.

What changes numberless have passed and still

Must pass hereafter over. plain and hill !

Thus fortune's favourite bore Zahhak toward

Shi'rkhan, and driving him among the mountains

Was purposing to cast him headlong down,

When carne the blest Surush and whispered thus

The prince in friendly wise :

> Convey the captive
>
> Thus to Mount Dainawand with speed, and take
>
> No escort, or but what thy safety needeth.

He bore Zahhak as one that rideth post

And fettered him upon Mount Damawand ;

So when new bonds were added to the old,

And fate had not another ill in store,

The glory of Zahhak became like dust

And earth was cleansed from his abominations,

He was removed from kindred and from friends,

And bonds alone were left him in the mountains,

Where Faridun chose out a narrow gorge —

A chasm which he had marked of viewless depth —

And having studded it with heavy nails,

Whereon the brain might chafe, secured Zahhak,

Bound by the hands upon a crag, that so

His anguish might endure. Thus was he left

To hang : his heart's blood trickled to the ground.

Come let us, lest we tread the world for ill,

Be on attaining every good intent ;

No good or evil will endure but still

Good furnisheth the better monument.

A lofty palace, wealth of every kind,

Will not avail ; thy monument on earth

Will be the reputation left behind

And therefore deem it not of little worth.

No angel was the glorious Fan'dun,

Not musk and ambergris ; he strove to win

By justice and beneficence the boon

Of greatness : be a Farfdiin therein.

By godlike travail undertaken he

First cleansed the world from its iniquity.

The binding of Zahhak, that loathly one

Devoid of justice, was the chief deed done.

He next avenged the murder of Abtln,

Caused all the world to recognise his sway,

And lastly purged the surface of earth clean

Of madmen, and took miscreants' power away.

.0 world ! how loveless and malign art thou

To breed the quarry and then hunt it down !

Lo ! where is Fan'dun the valiant now,

Who took away from old Zahhak the crown ?

Upon this earth five hundred years he reigned

And then departing left an empty throne ;

Bequeathing earth to others, he retained

Of all that he possessed regret alone.

So is it with us whether great or small

And sheep or shepherd, 'tis the same with all.
