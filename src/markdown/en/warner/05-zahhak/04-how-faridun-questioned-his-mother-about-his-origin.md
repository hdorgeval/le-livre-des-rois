# How Faridun questioned his Mother about his Origin

v. 43 Now Faridun, when twice eight years had passed,

Sought out his mother on the plain and said : —
" Disclose thy secret, say who is my father,

ZAHHAK

153

What is my lineage, whom shall I declare
Myself in public ? Let me have the truth."

She said : " I will tell all, my noble boy !
Within fran erewhile lived one Abtm,
Of royal race, discerning mind, wise, brave,
And inoffensive, sprung from Tahmuras ;
Abti'n knew all the pedigree. Thy sire
And my dear spouse was he ; my days were dark
When we were parted. Now Zahhak the warlock
Stretched from Iran his hand against thy life,
But I concealed thee. Oh ! what woeful days
I passed while that brave youth — thy father — forfeited
His own sweet life for thee ! Now on Zahhak
The warlock's shoulders grew two snakes which
sucked

The life-breath of Iran, and thy sire's brains

Were taken from his head to feed them. I

In course of time came on an open pasture,

As yet unknown to fame, and there beheld

A cow like jocund spring, well shaped and coloured

From head to foot : before her sat her herd

Upon his heels as one before a king.

I put thee in his charge. For long he nursed thee v. 44

Upon his breast, the cow of peacock-hues

Supplying thee with milk that made thee thrive

Like some bold crocodile, until the tidings

Of cow and meadow reached the Shah, and then

I bare thee from the pasture in all haste

And fled fran and home and family.

He came and slew the noble, tender nurse

That could not speak to thee, then sent the dusi

Up from our home and turned it to ditch."

The prince, enraged thereat, mused on revenge,
And said with aching heart and knitted brows : —
" The lion groweth brave by venturing,

THE SHAH NAM A OF FIRDA USl

And since the sorcerer hath done his part

Mine is to take my scimitar and lay

His palace in the dust ; such is God's will."

She said : " This is not well ; thou canst not stand
Alone against the world. He hath the crown
And throne, and troops at his command, who come
From all the realm to battle when he willeth,
A hundred thousand strong. View not the world
With boyish eyes ; the laws of blood-revenge
Demand it not. Drunk with the wine of youth
Men think themselves the only ones on earth
And vapour, but be thy days mirth and joy.
Do thou, my son ! bear this advice in mind,
Give all words save thy mother's to the wind,"
