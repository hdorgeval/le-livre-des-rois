# How Faridun saw the Sisters of Jamshid

Then Faridun o'erthrew the talisman, j
Raised heaven-high by Zahhak, because he saw ^/
That it was not of God, with massive mace \

THE SHAH NAM A OF FIRDAUSt

Laid low the sorcerers within the palace —
All fierce and notable divs — and set himself
Upon the enchanter's throne. This done he took
Possession of the royal crown and palace,
But though he searched he failed to find Zahhak.
Then from the women's bower he brought two Idols
Sun-faced, dark-eyed ; he had them bathed, he purged
The darkness of their minds by teaching them
,The way of God and made them wholly clean ;
For idol-worshippers had brought them up
And they were dazed in mind like drunken folk.
Then while the tears from their bright eyes bedewed
Their rosy cheeks those sisters of Jamshfd
Said thus to Faridun : " Mayst thou be young
Till earth is old ! What star was this of thine,

favoured one ! What tree bore thee as fruit,
Who venturest inside the Lion's lair

./ So hardily, thou mighty man of valour ?

\ What anguish and what bale have we endured

All through this dragon-shouldered Ahriman !
v. 54 \* Oh ! what a miserable world for us

Did this infatuated sorcerer make !

Yet saw we never here a man so hardy,

Bold, and ambitious as to think that he

Could take the throne."

He answered : " Throne and fortune

Abide with none. My sire was fortune's favourite,

But still Zahhak seized on him in Iran

And slew him cruelly, so I have set

My face against Zahhak's throne in revenge.

He slew the cow Birmaya too — my nurse,

A very gem of beauty. What could he,

That villain, gain by slaughtering that dumb beast ?

Now I am ready and I purpose war ;

1 came not from fran to bring him pardon,

ZAHHAK

163

Or good will, but to brain him in revenge
With this ox-headed mace/'

When Arnawaz
Heard this she guessed the secret, and replied: —
" Then thou art Faridun the Shah and wilt |
Abolish necromacy and black art, 1
For thou art fated to destroy Zahhak :
The binding of thy loins will loose the world.
We twain, pure, modest, and of royal seed,
Submitted only through the fear of death,
Else would we ever sleep or wake, king !
Beside a serpent-spouse ? "

Then Faridun : —
" If heaven over us shall do me right
I will cut off this Dragon from the earth,
And purge the world of its impurity.
Now speak the truth at once and tell me where
That vile one is."

Those fair dames told him all ;
They thought : " The Dragon's head will meet the
shears,"

And said : " He went to Hindustan to practise
Some spell- work in that land of sorcerers.
He will cut off a thousand innocent heads, v. 55

For he is terror-struck at evil fortune,
Because a seer hath said : ' Earth will be void
Of thee, for Faridun will seize thy throne
And thy prosperity wither in a moment/
Struck by the words his heart is all aflame,
And life affordeth him no happiness.
Now is he slaughtering beasts and men and
women

To make a bath of blood and thus defeat

That prophecy. Those serpents on his shoulders

Keep him in long and sore disquietude.

the shahnAma of firda usf

From clime to clime he roveth, for the snakes
Give him no rest. 'Tis time for his return,
But place there is not."

Stricken to the heart
That lovely pair revealed the mystery :
The exalted chieftain listened eagerly.
