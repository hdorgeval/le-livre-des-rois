# How Faridun went to Battle with Zahhak

With head raised o'er the sun he girt his loins

For vengeance for his father, and set forth

Upon the day Khurdad right joyfully

With favouring stars and splendid auguries.

The troops assembled at his gate, his throne

Was lifted to the clouds. The first to go

Were baggage and provisions for the army v. 50

On buffaloes and high-necked elephants.

Purmaya rode with Kaianush beside

The Shah, like younger brothers and true friends.

He went like wind from stage to stage ; revenge

Was in his head and justice in his heart.

The warriors on their Arab chargers reached

A spot where people dwelt who worshipped God,

And Faridun dismounting greeted them.

When night was darkening one in friendly guise

Approached him, walking with a measured tread,

With musky hair descending to the feet

And favoured like a maid of Paradise.

It was Surush, who came thence to advise

The king of good and ill, came like a fairy

And taught him privily the magic art,

That he might know the key of every lock

And by his spells bring hidden things to light ;

While Faridun, perceiving that the work

Was God's not Ahriman's or come of evil,

Flushed like a cercis-bloom and joyed to see

How lusty he and his young fortune were.

The cooks prepared a feast — a noble banquet,

One fit for mighty men. Now Faridun,

The drinking done, being heavy sought repose.

His brothers, seeing that God sped his cause,

And that his fortune slumbered not, departed

Without delay to compass his destruction.

There was above their heads a lofty cliff

And underneath the Shah slept peacefully.

His two abandoned brothers scaled the height

That night unseen, and scrupling at no crime

Set loose a mighty crag upon the brow

To fall directly on their brother's head,

And kill him in his sleep. The crashing crag,

For God so ordered, roused the slumber,er,

Who by his magic art arrested it '

In mid career : it stopped dead. Farfdun

Went on his way but kept the matter secret.

In front marched Kawa with the Kawian standard,

I Soon to become the ensign of the realm.

Thus Faridun advanced, as one who sought

A diadem, toward the Arwand, or call it,

As Arabs do, the Dijla, if thou knowest not

The ancient tongue. He marched another stage

And came upon the Dijla, at Baghdad.

On drawing near he sent to greet the guard

And said :

> Despatch to this side instantly
>
> Your boats and vessels, bear me across with all
>
> Mine army and let none be left behind.

The river-guard sent not his boats nor came

At Fari'diin's behest, but made reply :

> The Shah gave privy orders : ' Launch no boat
>
> Without a passport under mine own seal.'

The prince, enraged and fearless of the stream,

Girt like a king and bent upon revenge,

Plunged with his rose-red charger in the flood.

With one accord his comrades girt themselves,

Turned toward the stream, and on their brave, fleet

steeds

Plunged over saddle-back. The warriors' heads

Reeled while their swift steeds struggled with the tide,

And with their necks emerging seemed to be

The phantom cohort of a dream. The warriors

Reached the dry land undamped in their revenge

And set their faces toward Bait al Mukaddas.

This men called when they used the ancient tongue

Gang-i-Dizhukht ; to-day 'tis known among

The Arabs as "The Holy Place." The fair

Tall palace of Zahhak was builded there.

When they approached the city that they sought,

And Faridun beheld it a mile off,

He saw a pile whose building towered o'er Saturn,

So that thou wouldst have said :

> Twill catch the stars !

It shone like Jupiter in heaven ; the place

Appeared all peace and love and happiness.

The hero recognised that seat of power

And springlike beauty as the Dragon's dwelling,

And said :

> The man who reared a pile like that
>
> From dust I fear me cottoneth with the world,
>
> But still 'tis better to press on than tarry.

This said he grasped his massive mace and gave

His fleet steed rein, and thou hadst said :

> A flame
>
> Shot up before the guards.

He entered riding — ,

An inexperienced but valiant youth,

Who called upon the name of God — while they

That were on guard fled from him in dismay.
