# How Zahhak saw Faridun in a Dream

Observe God's dealings with Zahhak when he
Had forty years to live. One longsome night
He slumbered in the arms of Arnawaz,
And saw a vision of three warriors —
Boughs of the tree of kings. The youngest one,
Who held the middle place, was cypress tall,
In face, in armour, and in mien a king.
He rushed with ox-head mace to fight Zahhak,
Smote him upon the head, stripped off his skin,
And used it as a rope to bind his hands
Firm as a rock, 1 placed on his neck a yoke,
Then casting earth and dust upon his head

1 Cf. Keresdspa's account of his treatment of Gandarep. See intro-
ductory note to Farldun.

T48 THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUSf

Dragged him before the crowd in shame and anguish
Toward Mount Damawand.

The tyrant writhed :
Thou wouldst have said : " His liver split with fright."
He yelled. The palace of the hundred columns
Shook, and the sun-faced ladies left their couches,
While Arnaw&amp;z said to him : " Shah ! what was it ?
Confide in me ; thou wast asleep in peace
At home ! What saw'st thou ? Say what came to thee ?
The world is at thy will, beast, di'v, and man
v. 38 Watch o'er thee and the seven climes are thine —

All 'twixt the moon and Fish. 1 What made thee start ?
master of the world ! Oh ! answer me."

The chief replied : " I may not tell, or else
Ye will despair my life."

Then Arnawaz : —
" Be pleased to tell us ; we perchance may find
A cure, no ill is irremediable."

He told them every whit, then said the Fair : —
" Neglect it not but seek a remedy.
Thy throne's seat is the signet of the age,
Thy famous fortune brighteneth the world,
Beneath thy finger-ring thou hast the earth
With all its fairies, divs, beasts, fowls, and men.
Call both the archmages and astrologers —
The wisest of each realm — and tell them all.
See if the hand that threateneth thy life
Is that of fairy, di'v, or man. This known
Act vigorously; quail not before thy foes."

The lady^s counsel pleased the Shah.

Night then

Was dark as raven's plumes, but when at length
The Lamp showed o'er the hills, and thou hadst said,
" Strewed yellow gems upon the azure vault,"

ZAHHAK

49

Zahhak brought archimages shrewd of heart

And told to them the dream that pierced his liver.

He said : " Expound this dream without delay, v. 39

And make my soul a pathway toward the light."

He asked them privily about the future,
Demanding : " What will be my latter end,
And who succeed me ? Tell or hide your heads
In shame."

They talked together sad at heart,
With parched lips and with sallow countenances :
They said : " If we tell truly what is fated
We shall be tortured, haply lose our lives ;
And if we do not act straightforwardly
As well wash hands of life."

None dared to speak :
Their fortune was in jeopardy three days.
Upon the fourth the Shah was wroth, exclaiming : —
" Foretell the future or be hung alive." ,
They drooped their heads, their hearts were rent,
their eyes

Wept tears of blood. Among them was a man,

Wise, honest, prescient, by name ^Zirak —

The chief of all the band of archimages.

Concerned but fearless he addressed Zahhak : —

" Indulge no vapouring for none is born

Except to die. There have been kings ere thee

Fit for the throne of power. Both griefs and joys

Enough they reckoned up yet their time came.

If thou wert standing there — an iron wall —

Yon heaven would grind thee, thou wouldst not endure.

One will hereafter take thy throne and fling

Thy fortune to the ground. His name is Faridun,

And he will be a royal heaven to earth.

As yet he is not born, thy time of woe v. 40

Hath not arrived, but when his honoured mother

Hath borne him he will be a fruitful tree.

THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUSI

At man's estate his head will reach the moon

And he will seek thy belt, crown, throne, and casque.

In stature a tall cypress, he will shoulder

A mace of steel, will smite thy head therewith

And drag thee from the palace to the street

In bonds."

" Why bind me," said the impious king,
" In vengeance ? "

Then Zirak : " Wert thou but wise . . . !
But all make pretexts for injurious acts.
Thy hand will slay his father and that wrong
Will fill the son's brains with revengeful thoughts:
Besides the nurse of this young atheling —
The cow, Birmaya hight — will perish too
By thy hand ; so in vengeance he will brandish
An ox-head mace."

Zahhak heard anxiously,
And swooned upon his throne. The noble archmage
Turned him and fled away in dread of ill.
The Sh&amp;h recovered and resumed his seat.
He diligently sought throughout the world
For traces faint or clear of Faridiin ;
No food, no slumber, or repose took he,
His daylight turned to lapislazuli.
