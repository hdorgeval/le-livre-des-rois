# How Iblis turned Cook

Then as a youth well spoken, clean, and clever,

Iblis went to Zahhak with fawning words,

> Let me,

he said,

> who am a noted cook,
>
> Find favour with the king.

By appetite

Seduced, Zahhak received and welcomed him,

So that the monarch's faithful minister

Gave to Ibh's the royal kitchen's key.

Foods then were few, men did not kill to eat

But lived on vegetals of all earth's produce ;

So evil-doing Ahriman designed

To slaughter animals for food, and served

I Both bird and beast. He fed the king on blood

To make him lion-fierce, and like a slave

Obeyed him. First he fed his lord on yelk

To make him strong ; he liked the flavour much

And praised Iblis, who said :

> Illustrious monarch !
>
> For ever live ! To-morrow I will serve thee
>
> So as to please thee well.

All night he mused

What strange repast to proffer on the morrow,

And when the azure vault brought back again

The golden Gem he hopefully presented

A meal of partridges and silver pheasants.

The Arab monarch ate and his small wits

Were lost in admiration. On the third day

Ibh's served lamb and fowl, and on the fourth

A chine of veal with saffron and rosewater,

Musk and old wine. Zahhak when he had tasted,

In wonder at his cook's ability,

Said :

> Worthy friend ! ask thou my recompense.

He answered :

> Live, king ! in wealth and power.
>
> My heart is thine, thy favour my soul's food ;
>
> Yet would I ask one boon above my station :
>
> 'Tis leave to kiss and lay my face and eyes
>
> Upon thy shoulders.

Off his guard Zahhak

Replied :

> I grant it ; it may do thee grace.

Iblis received permission, kissed and vanished.

A marvel followed â€” from the monarch's shoulders

Grew two black snakes. Distraught he sought a cure

And in the end excised them, but they grew

Again ! oh strange ! like branches from a tree.

The ablest leeches gave advice in turn

And used their curious arts but all in vain.

At length Ibli's himself came hurrying

Dight as a leech.

> This was thy destiny,

He said ;

> cut not the snakes but let them live.
>
> Give them men's brains and gorge them till they sleep,
>
> It is the only means, such food may kill them.

The purpose of the foul Div shrewdly scan :

Had he conceived perchance a secret plan

To rid the world of all the race of man ?
