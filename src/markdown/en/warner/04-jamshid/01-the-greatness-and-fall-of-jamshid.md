# The Greatness and Fall of Jamshid

Jamshid, the mighty son of Tahmuras,

Full of his father's maxims, girt himself,

Succeeded to his glorious father's throne,

And wore in kingly wise the crown of gold.

His girdle was the Grace of king of kings,

And all the world obeyed him, contests ceased,

The age had rest, and bird and dfv and fairy

Were his to bid, the world took added lustre,

Through him the throne of Shahs was glorified.

> Mine is the Grace,

he said,

> I am both king
>
> And archimage, I will restrain ill-doers
>
> And make for souls a path toward the light.

He first wrought arms and oped for warriors

The door of fame. His Grace made iron yield ;

He fashioned it to helmets, hauberks, breastplates,

And coats of armour both for man and horse.

His ardent mind achieved the work and made

Good store in fifty years. Another fifty

He spent on raiment fit for fight or feast ;

And made of spun and floss silk, hair and cotton,

Fine fabrics, cloth of hair and rich brocade.

He taught to spin and weave, and when the stuffs

Were made he showed men how to full and sew them

Then to the joy of all he founded castes

For every craft ; it took him fifty years.

Distinguishing one caste as sacerdotal

To be employed in sacred offices,

He separated it from other folk

And made its place of service on the mountains

That God might be adored in quietude.

Arrayed for battle on the other hand

Were those who formed the military caste ;

They were the lion-men inured to war —

The Lights of armies and of provinces —

Whose office was to guard the royal throne

And vindicate the nation's name for valour.

The third caste was the agricultural,

All independent tillers of the soil,

The sowers and the reapers — men whom none

Upbraideth when they eat. Though clothed in rags,

The wearers are not slaves, and sounds of chiding

Reach not their ears. They are free men and labour

Upon the soil safe from dispute and contest.

What said the noble man and eloquent ?

"'Tis idleness that maketh freemen slaves."

The fourth caste was the artizans. They live

By doing handiwork — a turbulent crew,

133

Who being always busied with their craft

Are given much to thought. Jamshfd thus spent

Another fifty years and did much good,

For each man learnt his place and others' too.

He bade the foul divs temper earth with water

And taught them how to fashion moulds for bricks.

They laid foundations first with stones and lime,

Then raised thereon by rules of art such structures

As hot baths, lofty halls, and sanctuaries.

He searched among the rocks for stones whose lustre

Attracted him and came on many a jewel,

As rubies, amber, silver, gold. Jamshid

Unlocked their doors and brought them forth by spells.

He introduced the scents that men enjoy

As camphor, genuine musk, gum Benjamin,

Sweet aloe, ambergris, and bright rosewater.

Next leechcraft and the healing of the sick,

The means of health, the course of maladies

Were secrets opened by Jamshfd : the world

Hath seen no other such discoverer.

He crossed the sea in ships. For fifty years

His wisdom brought to light the properties

Of things. These works achieved, Jamshid ambitioned

Rank loftier still, and by his royal Grace

Made him a throne, with what a wealth of gems

Inlaid I which when he willed the di'vs took up

And bare from earth to heaven. There the Shah,

Whose word was law, sat sunlike in mid air.

The world assembled round his throne in wonder

At his resplendent fortune, while on him

The people scattered jewels, and bestowed

Upon the day the name of New Year's Day,

The first of Farwardm and of the year,

When limbs repose from labour, hearts from strife.

The noble chieftains held a festival,

Called for the goblet, wine, and minstrelsy,

And ever since that time that glorious day

Remaineth the memorial of that Shah.

Thus things continued for three centuries,

And all the while men never looked on death ;

They wotted not of travail or of ill,

And divs like slaves were girt to do them service ;

Men hearkened to Jamshid with both their ears,

Sweet voices filled the world with melody,

And thus till many years had come and gone

The royal Grace shone brightly from the Shah :

His ends had been attained, the world reposed,

And still new revelations came from God,

Men saw but goodness in their king, the earth

Served him, he reigned — a monarch with the Grace.

One day contemplating the throne of power

He deemed that he was peerless. He knew God,

But acted frowardly and turned aside

In his ingratitude. He summoned all

The chiefs, and what a wealth of words he used !

" The world is mine, I found its properties,

The royal throne hath seen no king like me,

For I have decked the world with excellence

And fashioned earth according to my will.

From me derive your provand, ease, and sleep,

Your raiment and your pleasure. Mine are greatness

And diadem and sovereignty. Who saith

That there is any great king save myself ?

Leechcraft hath cured the world, disease and death

Are stayed. Though kings are many who but I

Saved men from death ? Ye owe me sense and life :

They who adore me not are Ahrimans.

So now that ye perceive what I have done

All hail me as the Maker of the world."

Thereat the archmages hung their heads, perplexed

To answer and God's Grace departed from him,

The world was filled with din, the Court deserted,

None who desired renown stayed in his presence.

For three and twenty years the empty portal

Told of the crime that equalled him with God,

Brought on disaster and overturned the state.

How saith the seer, the man of Grace and wisdom ?

" King though thou art serve God. Great fears

oppress

The heart that is devoid of thankfulness."

Day darkened to Jamshid, he lost the Grace

That lighteneth the world, and though with tears

Of blood he sought for pardon Grace was not,

And dread of coming evil was his lot.
