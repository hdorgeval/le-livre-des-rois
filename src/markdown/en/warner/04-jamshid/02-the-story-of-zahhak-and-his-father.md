# The Story of Zahhak and his Father

One of the desert spear-armed Bedouins

Of noble birth then lived — a virtuous king,

Just, highborn, generous, and hight Mardas,

Who sought his God with reverence and sighs,

He kept a thousand head of all milch cattle,

Goats, camels, sheep, and kine — a gentle breed —

With Arab steeds, all timid beauties they,

And grudged the milk to none. He had a son

Whom much he loved — Zahhak, a gallant prince,

But hasty. People called him Biwarasp.

Ten thousand is "biwar" in ancient Persian,

And he possessed ten thousand Arab steeds

With golden equipage — a famous stud.

Most of his days and nights he spent on horseback

Engaged in superintendence not in war.

One day Iblis approached him as a friend

And led his wits astray. The youth gave ear

With pleasure and all unsuspectingly

Gave to Iblis heart, reason, and pure soul,

And heaped the dust on his own head. Iblis

Exulted seeing that the youth was snared

And gulled the simpleton with specious words,

Thus saying :

> I could tell thee many things
>
> Known to myself alone.

The youth made answer :

> Tell me at once, my worthy monitor !

Iblis replied :

> First promise, then my story.

The guileless youth swore as Iblis dictated :

> Thy secret shall be kept, thy bidding done.

Then said Iblis :

> Great prince ! Shall any rule
>
> Here but thyself ? What profiteth a sire
>
> With such a son ? Now hearken to my rede :
>
> The lifetime of this ancient potentate
>
> Continueth, thou art shelved. Seize on his court
>
> And goods. His place will suit thee, thou shalt be
>
> King of the world if thou durst do my bidding.

Zahhak looked grave ; to shed his sire's blood grieved him.

He said :

> Not so, suggest some other course :
>
> This cannot be.

> Then thou,

Iblis rejoined,

> Art perjured and wilt still be despicable,
>
> Thy father honoured.

Thus, he snared the Arab,

Who asked :

> What must I do ? I will obey.

Iblis replied :

> Leave me to scheme. Thy head
>
> Shall touch the sun. I only ask thy silence ;
>
> No help need I, myself am competent,
>
> But keep the sword of speech within the scabbard.

Now in the palace was a jocund garth,

And thither used Mardas to go at dawn

To bathe him ere he prayed, without a slave

To light him on his way, The wicked Div,

Intent on ill, dug in the garden-path

A deep pit, masked and made it good with boughs.

Ere dawn the Arab chieftain hied him thither

And, as he reached the pit, his fortunes fell ;

That good man tumbled, broke his back, and died.

He ne'er had breathed a cold breath on his son,

But cherished him and lavished treasure on him,

Yet that abandoned youth respected not

His father, but conspired to shed his blood.

I heard a sage once say :

> Though fierce in strife
>
> No son will dare to take his father's life ;
>
> If such a crime should seem to be implied,
>
> Seek for the reason on the mother's side.

Vile and unjust Zahhak thus seized the throne,

Assumed the Arabs' crown and governed them

For good or ill. Iblis encouraged thus

Began again and said :

> Since thou hast turned
>
> To me, and gained thy heart's desire, come pledge me
>
> Thy word once more to do as I require ;
>
> And then thy realm shall spread throughout the world,
>
> Birds, beasts, and fishes shall be all thine own.

When this was said he set about to use,

Most marvellous ! Another kind of ruse.
