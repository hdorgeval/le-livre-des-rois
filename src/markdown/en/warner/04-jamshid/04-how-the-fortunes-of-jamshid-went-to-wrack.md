# How the Fortunes of Jamshid went to Wrack

Thereafter tumult, combating and strife

Arose throughout fran, the bright day gloomed

And men renounced Jamshid, who when his Grace

Was darkened turned to folly and perverseness.

Pretenders started up, on every march

The disaffected nobles levied troops

And strove. Some set forth for Arabia,

For they had heard :

> There is a monarch there —
>
> An awe-inspiring king of dragon-visage.

Thus all the discontented cavaliers

Went to Zahhak and offered fealty,

Saluting him as monarch of Iran.

The king of dragon-visage came like wind

And donned the Iranian crown, collected troops —

The bravest of Arabia and Iran —

And having seized the throne of Shah Jamshid

Slipped on the world as 'twere a finger-ring.

Thus fell Jamshid. Pressed by the world's new lord

He fled, surrendering crown, throne and treasure,

Host, power and diadem. The world turned black

To him, he disappeared and yielded all.

He was in hiding for a century,

But in the hundredth year the impious Shah

Appeared one day beside the sea of Chin.

Zahhak clutched him forthwith, gave him small respite,

And sawing him asunder freed the world

From him and from the fear that he inspired.

Long was he hidden from the Dragon's breath,

But there was no escaping in the end,

For fortune whirled him like a yellow straw

And both his throne and greatness passed away.

What better Shah was ever on the throne,

And yet what profit could he call his own

From all his toils ? His seven centuries

Brought him great blessings and calamities.

What need hast thou then for a length of years ?

The world will keep its secrets though for food

It give thee sweets and honeycomb, and rude

Ungentle voices banish from thine ears.

Wilt thou then say :

> Its love is spent on me,
>
> In every look affection is expressed ?

Wilt thou confide therein caressingly

And tell it all the secrets of thy breast ?

'Twill play with thee a pretty game indeed

Anon, and cause thy wretched heart to bleed.

My heart is weary of this Wayside Inn :

God ! release me soon from toil therein.
