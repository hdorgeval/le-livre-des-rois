# The Birth of Minuchihr

Mark what a wonder yon blue vault revealed

When nine months had elapsed ! That virtuous dame

Brought forth a son fit for the crown and throne,

Who from his tender mother's womb was brought

Without delay before the mighty Shah.

The bearer said :

> master of the crown !
>
> Let all thy heart be joy: behold fraj !

The world-divider's lips were full of smiles ;

Thou wouldst have said :

> His own fraj doth live.

He clasped the noble child and prayed the Almighty :

> Oh ! would that I might have mine eyes again,
>
> v - 95 That God would show to me this infant's face.

He prayed so earnestly that God vouchsafed

To give his sight back. When with open eyes

He gazed on that new-comer's face he cried :

" Be this day blest and our foes' hearts plucked out ! "

He brought bright wine and splendid cups and called

That babe of open visage Miniichihr,

And said :

> From two pure parents there hath come
>
> A proper branch to fruit.

He reared the babe

So tenderly that not a breath passed o'er him.

The slave that carried him upon her breast

Trod not the ground, for underneath her feet

The purest musk was strewn, and as she walked

A sunshade of brocade was o'er her head.

Years passed, no ill befell him from the stars ;

' Meanwhile the famous monarch taught the child

All those accomplishments that kings require.

1 The word here translated " open visage" is "mantfohihr." For the

true meaning of Minuohihr see introductory note to the next reign.

FARlDUN

When Faridun had got back sight and heart,

And all the world was talking of the boy,

His grandsire gave to him a golden throne,

A princely turquoise crown, a massive mace

And treasury-key with thrones, torques, casques, and

girdles,

A bright-hued tent-enclosure of brocade

With tents of leopard-skin, such Arab steeds

With golden furniture, such Indian scimitars

With golden sheaths, such store of casques and breast-

plates,

With buttoned hauberks made in Rum and bows

From Chach and poplar shafts and shields from Chm

And double-headed javelins of war !

Thus Faridun bestowed his hard-won treasures, v. 96

Convinced that Minuchihr was well deserving,

And felt his own heart full of love for him.

He summoned all his paladins and nobles,

Who came intent on vengeance for fraj,

And offered homage, showering emeralds

Upon his crown. On that great new-made feast

The sheep and wolf walked side by side on earth.

The leaders were Karan, the son of Kawa,

The chief Sirirwf, the fierce and lion-like,

Garshasp the noble swordsman, Sam the champion,

The son of Nariman, Kubad, Kishwad, —

He of the golden helm — and many more

Illustrious men, — the safeguards of the world —

And when the work of gathering troops was done

The Shah's head towered over every one.
