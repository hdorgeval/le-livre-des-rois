# How Faridun divided the World among his Sons

These secrets known, the Shah divided earth

And made three realms : he joined Rum with the

West,

Turan with Chin, Arabia with Iran.

He first took thought for Salm and gave him Rum

And all the West, commanding him to lead

An army thither ; so Salm took the throne,

And all the West saluted him as lord.

Next Fan'dun assigned Turan to Tur

To rule the Turkmans and the land of Chin,

Providing troops ; Tur led his army forth,

Arrived, assumed the seat of sovereignty,

Girt up his loins and opened wide his hands.

The nobles showered upon him precious stones,

And all Turan hailed him as king, fraj

Came last, the sire selected all Iran

For him. This with Arabia and the throne

Of majesty and crown of chiefs he gave,

Perceiving that fraj deserved to rule.

How all the princes, prudent, wise, and shrewd,

All-hailed him as the master of Iran !

As marchlords thus these men of noble birth

Acceded to their thrones in peace and mirth.
