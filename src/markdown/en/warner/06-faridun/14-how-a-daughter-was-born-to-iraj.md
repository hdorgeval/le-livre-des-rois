# How a Daughter was Born to Iraj

A while passed and the Shah went in to view

1 raj's bower, inspected it and marked

The moon-faced beauties who resided there.

He saw a slave of lovely countenance,

Whose name was Mah Afrid. fraj had loved her,

And fate decreed that she should bear him fruit.

The Shah rejoiced because she was with child,

Which gave him hope of vengeance for his son,

But when her time was come she bore a daughter,

And hope deferred hung heavy on the Shah.

He nursed the babe with joy and tenderness,

And all the folk began to cherish her

As she increased in stature and in charms.

Thou wouldst have said to her the tulip-cheeked :

> Thou art fraj himself from head to foot.

When she was old enough to wed — a Pleiad

In countenance with hair as black as pitch —

Her grandsire chose Pashang to be her spouse :

Pashang was brother's son to Faridun,

Descended from a noble ancestry,

A hero of the seed of Shah Jamshid,

Meet for the kingship, diadem, and throne ;

And in this way no little time passed on.
