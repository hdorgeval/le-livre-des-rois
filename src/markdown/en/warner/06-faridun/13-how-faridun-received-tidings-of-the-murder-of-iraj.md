# How Faridun received Tidings of the Murder of Iraj

The eyes of Faridun were on the road,

Both host and crown were longing for the prince ;

But when the time arrived for his return

How did the tidings reach his father first ?

He had prepared the prince a turquoise throne

And added jewels to his crown. The people

Were all in readiness to welcome him

And called for wine and song and minstrelsy.

They brought out drums and stately elephants,

And put up decorations everywhere

Throughout his province. While the Shah and troops

Were busied thus a cloud of dust appeared,

And from its midst a dromedary ridden

By one in grief who uttered bitter cries ;

He bore a golden casket, and therein

The prince's head enwrapped in painted silk.

The good man came with woeful countenance

To Faridun and wailed aloud. They raised

The golden casket's lid (for every one

FARtDJJN

Believed the words of him who bore it wild)

And taking out the painted silk beheld

Within the severed head of prince Iraj.

Down from his steed fell Faridun, the troops

All rent their clothes, their looks were black, their eyes

Blanched with their horror, for the spectacle

Was other far than that they hoped to see.

Since in this wise the young king came again
The troops that went to meet him thus returned —
Their banners rent, their kettledrums reversed,
The warriors' cheeks like ebony, the tymbals
And faces of the elephants all blackened, v. 92

The prince's Arabs splashed with indigo.
Both Shah and warriors fared alike on foot,
Their heads all dust y the paladins in anguish
Bewailed that noble man and tore their arms.

Be on thy guard as touching this world's love ;
A bow is useless if it be not bent.

The process of the turning sky above
Is, favouring first, to plunder in the event.

'Twill countenance an open enemy
While those who seek its favour are denied.

One goodly counsel I address to thee :
Let no love for it in thy heart abide.

The troops heart-seared, the Shah with cries " Alas !
Alas ! " went toward the garden of Iraj
Where he delighted to hold festival
On any royal anniversary.
The monarch entered bearing his son's head,
Beheld the hauzes 1 and the cypresses,

1 u Behind the state apartments is a beautiful and luxuriant garden,
cooled by magnificent hauzes, or ornamental ponds, with stone edges,
which keep the water about a foot above the level of the ground ; as
the water always gently overflows these edges, a 9leepy murmur is
produced, and the air is cooled by the large evaporating surface." —

THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUSt

The trees a-bloom, the willows and the quinces,
Saw too and strewed dark dust upon the throne
Imperial but unprinced and lustreless
While up to Saturn rose the soldiers\* wail.
He cried "Alas ! Alas !" plucked out his hair,
He poured down tears, he tore his face and girt
Around his loins a rope besmirched with blood.
He fired the house wherein fraj had dwelt,
Destroyed the rose-beds, burnt the cypress-trees
And closed up once for all the eye of joy.
He placed the prince's head upon his breast,
And said with head turned God-ward : " Righteous
Judge !

Look down upon this murdered innocent,
Whose severed head is here befor\* me now,
While foreign lions have devoured his body.
V. 93 Do Thou so burn up those two miscreants 1 hearts
That they may never see a bright day more.
So pierce and sear the livers of them both
That even beasts of prey shall pity them.
Oh ! grant me, Thou that judgest righteously !
So long a respite from the day of death
That I may see descended from fraj
One born to fame, and girded to avenge.
Let him behead those two injurious men
As they beheaded him who wronged them not,
And when I have beheld it let me go
Where earth shall take the measure of my height. 55

He wept thus many days and bitterly.
His pillow was the dust, his bed the ground
Until the herbage grew about his breast
And both those lustrous eyes of his were dimmed.
He gave no audience, but without surcease
Cried out with bitterness : " gallant youth !
No wearer of a crown hath ever died

FA RID UN

205

As thou hast died, thou famous warrior !
Thou wast beheaded by vile Ahriman ;
The maw of lions was thy winding-sheet."

Wails, sobs, and cries robbed e'en the beasts of sleep,
While men and women gathered into crowds
In every province, weeping and heart-broken.
How many days they sat in their distress —
A death in life of utter hopelessness !
