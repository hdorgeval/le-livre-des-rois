# How Salm grew Envious of Iraj

Much time rolled on, while fate reserved its secrets,

Till wise Shah Fan'dun was worn with age

And strewed with dust the Garden of his Spring.

This is the common lot of all mankind —

Man's strength is weakness when he groweth old.

Then gloom began to gather in the state,

The princes of the realm waxed turbulent.

Immersed in greed Salm changed in heart and mind,

 He sat in conclave, for he much misliked

His sire's apportionment, which gave fraj

The throne of gold. In rancour and with frowns

He hurried off a camel-post, an envoy,

To give this message to the king of Chin :

> Live ever glad and happy ! Know, great king
>
> Of Turkmans and of Chin ! that our shrewd hearts
>
> Did ill to acquiesce when we were wronged :
>
> Though we are cypress-tall our souls are base.
>
> Mark with discerning heart this tale of mine ;
>
> None such hath reached thee from the days of
>
> old :—
>
> Three sons were we who graced our father's throne,
>
> And now the youngest hath the chiefest place !
>
> Since I am first in wisdom and in years
>
> Such fortune doth befit my signet-ring,
>
> While if crown, throne, and diadem should pass
>
> From me, king ! should they not deck thyself?
>
> Shall both of us continue thus aggrieved
>
> By that injustice which our father did
>
> In giving to fraj fran, Yaman,
>
> And Araby ; the West and Rum to me ;
>
> To thee the wastes of Turkestan and Chm ?
>
> The youngest hath Iran ; I cannot brook
>
> This settlement ; thy father must be mad.

The message filled Tur's brainless head with wind,

And savage as a lion he replied :

> Heed well my words and tell them to thy lord : —
>
> ' It was when we were youths, most just king !
>
> That we were cheated by our father thus.
>
> This is a tree which his own hands have set ;
>
> The fruit is blood, the leafage colocynth ;
>
> So let us meet and parley as to this, v. So
>
> Fix on our course of action and raise troops.'

Now when the envoy brought this answer back

The face of that veiled secret was laid bare,

This brother came from Chin and that from Rum,

And, poison being mixed with honey thus,

They met together to deliberate

The matter both in council and in state.
