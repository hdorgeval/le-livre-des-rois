# How the King of Yaman answered Jandal

At length he called the Shah's ambassador

And spake to him at large in gracious words: —

" I am the servant of thy lord ; in all

That he commandeth me will I obey.

Thus say to him : ' Exalted as thou art,

Still thy three sons are precious unto thee ;

And kings esteem their own sons very precious

When they are such as ornament the throne.

I grant what thou hast said, I too have children

And judge by them ; yet if the mighty Shah

Were to require mine eyes of me, or ask

The kingdom of Yaman and desert-tribes,

It were of lesser moment than for me

To never look upon my children more ;

Still if the Shah wish this I may not walk

Save as he biddeth me, and my three children,

If so he will, shall cease to be my kin ;

But when shall I behold those princely sons

Who are the lustre of thy crown and throne ?

Let those blithe youths come hither and illume

My gloomy soul; to see them will rejoice

My heart, and I will contemplate their shrewdness ;

Then I will give to them my three bright Eyes

According to our customs. Furthermore,

When I perceive that they are upright men,

I will join hand in hand in league with them,

And whensoe'er the Shah would see his sons

They shall return,' "

Jandal, the sweet-voiced speaker

On hearing kissed the throne with reverence,

Then uttering praises hied him to his lord,

To whom he told what he had said and heard.

The monarch bade his sons attend, he spake

About the mission of Jandal, and said :

> The monarch of Yaman is king of peoples,
>
> Sarv is a cypress throwing lengthy shadows.
>
> He hath three daughters — pearls as yet unpierced —
>
> Who are his crown, for he hath not a son.
>
> Before all three of them Surush would kiss
>
> The ground, I ween, if he might have such brides.
>
> These I demanded of their sire for you
>
> And took such order as becometh us.
>
> Your duty now will be to go to him,
>
> But be discreet in all things small and great.
>
> Bo complaisant but guarded therewithal,
>
> Heed what he saith and answer courteously.
>
> If he consulteth you advise him well.
>
> Now hearken to my words and ye shall prosper:
>
> Among the peoples none can equal Sarv,
>
> For he is fluent, ardent, shrewd, and pure.
>
> Allow him not to find you off your guard,
>
> For wise men work with subtilty. The first day
>
> He will assign you chief seats at a feast,
>
> Bring forth three sun-faced maids like garths in spring,
>
> All full of grace, of colour, and perfume,
>
> And seat them on the throne, these Cypresses
>
> In height and in appearance so alike
>
> That none could tell their order as to age.
>
> Now of these three the youngest will walk first,
>
> The eldest last, the other in the midst.
>
> The king will place the youngest maid beside
>
> The eldest youth, beside the youngest prince
>
> The eldest maid, and pair the mid in age.
>
> Know, for 'tis worth your while, that he will ask : —
>
> ' How range ye in respect of age these damsels ? '
>
> Reply : ' The youngest hath the highest place,
>
> The eldest hath a place below her rank,
>
> The raid in age is placed as she should be,
>
> And thou hast failed in this attempt of thine,'

The pure and high-born three paid all regard

To what their father said, and left his presence

Fulfilled with wisdom and with artifice.

How should the sons by such a father taught

Be ill advised or indiscreet in aught ?
