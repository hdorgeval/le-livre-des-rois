# How Sarv proved the Sons of Faridun by Sorcery

v. 73 Then Sarv assembled boon-companions

And passed the day with minstrels, wine, and talk,

But his three sons-in-law — the sons of Faridun —

Drank not except to him. When wine prevailed,

And sleep and rest were needed, Sarv bade set

Some couches by a fountain of rose-water,

And there the three illustrious athelings

Slept in a garden in a bower of roses,

Which scattered blossoms o'er them, but meanwhile

The sorcerer-king had thought of a device :

He left the royal pleasance and prepared

His spells. He brought a frost and mighty blast

To slay the princes ; over hill and plain

It froze so sharply that the crows grew numb.

The arch-enchanter Farfdiin's three sons

Leapt from their couches at the grievous cold;

FARiDtiN 185

And by the Graco of God and their own skill,
By kingly magic and their hardihood,
Opposed the spell and kept the frost away.
Now when the sun shone o'er the mountain-tops,
Sarv, anxious to know all, approached in haste
His three exalted sons-in-law in hope
To find their cheeks like lapislazuli,
Congealed with frost, and their emprise defeated,
So that his daughters might remain to him
As his memorial ; such was his hope,
But sun and moon were adverse to his wishes,
For he beheld three princes like new moons
Fresh-seated on their royal thrones, and knew
That spells had failed him and his time was lost.
He gave an audience ; all the chiefs attended. v. 74

He opened and brought forth his ancient treasures,
Disclosing what had been secreted long,
And brought too and committed to their lords
Three maids sun-cheeked, like garths of Paradise
(No archimage ere planted pines like them),
With crowns and trinkets, ignorant of pain,
Unless it be a pain to plait the hair :
They were three new Moons and three warrior-
kings.

He thought with bitterness : " The fault is mine,
Not Farfdun's, and may I never hear
Of female issue from this royal stock ;
He hath a lucky star who hath not daughters,
But he who hath them hath no star to shine."
Then to the assembled sages : " Kings may well
Wed Moons. Bear witness all ! that I have given
My three Eyes to these men in lawful marriage,
To hold them dear as their own eyes are dear,
And limn them like their own lives on their
hearts."

THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUSI

He uttered this aloud and then he bound
On many vigorous camels' lusty backs
The baggage of the brides. Yaman was bright
With gems. The daughters' litters moved in file
With parasols and riches fit for kings.
Sarv ordered everything and said farewell.
Thus did the youths set out upon their way
To Faridun with hearts alert and gay.
