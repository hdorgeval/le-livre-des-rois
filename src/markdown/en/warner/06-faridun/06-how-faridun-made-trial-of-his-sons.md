# How Faridun made Trial of his Sons

v. 7 - When tidings that the princes had returned

Reached Faridun he went to meet them, longing,

By trial of their characters, to end

His boding fears, so changed him to a dragon —

One, thou wouldst say, no lion could escape —

Which hissed and bellowed with its jaws aflame.

As soon as he perceived his three sons near,

Like sombre mountains in a cloud of dust,

He too threw dust about and made it fly,

While earth re-echoed with his bellowings.

He rushed in fury toward his eldest son,

That prince of many virtues, who exclaimed :

> No man of sense and wisdom thinketh good
>
> To fight with dragons.

Then he showed his back

And fled. The father turned toward the next,

His second son, who when he saw the dragon

Strung up his bow and drew it, saying thus :

> When fight is toward, what matter if the foe
>
> Be roaring lion or brave cavalier ?

But when the youngest son came up he looked

Upon the dragon and cried out :

> Avaunt !
>
> Thou art a leopard : ware the lions' path !
>
> 18
>
> If e'er the name of Faridun hath reached
>
> Thine ears contend not with us, for we three
>
> Are sons of his, and every one of us
>
> A wielder of the mace, and warrior.
>
> Unless thou turnest from thy waywardness
>
> I will discrown thee of thy loathly face.

The glorious Faridun thus heard and saw,

And having proved their, mettle disappeared.

He went away but came back as their sire

With all the pomp and circumstance befitting,

With kettledrums and huge fierce elephants

And bearing in his hand the ox-head mace.

The leaders of the host were at his back,

And all the world was his. The noble princes

Dismounted when they saw the Shah, they ran

To him and kissed the ground, dazed at the din

Made by the elephants and kettledrums.

The father grasped their hands and welcomed them,

Each to his proper place. On his return

He prayed and offered up much thanks to God —

The Author of his weal and of his woe —

Then summoned his three sons and seating them

Upon the throne of majesty spake thus :

> That loathly dragon which would scorch the world
>
> Was your own father, who desired to prove
>
> Your mettle, and this known returned with joy.
>
> Now in my wisdom I have chosen fit names
>
> For you. Thou art the eldest, be thou Salin
>
> And have thy wish on earth — thou soughtest
>
> safety
>
> And didst not shun to flee the monsters maw.
>
> The rash man who despiseth elephants
>
> Or lions — call him frantic and not brave.
>
> My second son, who from the first showed fight,
>
> Whose courage is more ardent than a flame,
>
> 88
>
> Him name we Tur — a lion brave ; not even
>
> A mighty elephant could vanquish him.
>
> To dare is all the virtues in his case,
>
> For no faint heart is master of a throne.
>
> The youngest is a man of sleight and fight,
>
> One that can bide his time and yet be prompt.
>
> He chose the middle course 'twixt dust and flame,
>
> The prudent man's. Brave, young, and sensible
>
> He must alone be praised. Be he Iraj,
>
> And may his end be all supremacy,
>
> Because at first he was not choleric,
>
> But at the time of stress his courage grew.
>
> I open now my lips with joy to name
>
> These Arab dames with fairy. countenances.

He named the wife of Salm, Arzii ; 1 the wife

Of Tur, Mah-i-Azada Khii ; the wife

Of blest Iraj, Sahl, to whom Canopus

Was but a slave in beauty. Afterwards

He brought a catalogue embracing all

The stars within the circling sphere of heaven,

Whose aspects readers of the stars had taken,

Spread it before him and observed the fortunes

Of his illustrious sons. Salm's horoscope

Was Jupiter in Sagittarius.

Next came the horoscope of glorious Tur —

The Sun ascendant in the Lion's House —

A presage brave ; but when the Shah observed

The horoscope of blest fraj he found

The Moon in Cancer ; thus the stars revealed

A destiny of strife and woe. The Shah

Was sorely troubled, with a deep cold sigh

Perceived that heaven loved not his bright-souled son,

And as he mused thereon he could not be

But filled with thoughts of grave anxiety.
