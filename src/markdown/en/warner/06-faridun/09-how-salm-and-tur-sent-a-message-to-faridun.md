# How Salm and Tur sent a Message to Faridun

They chose a priest, a shrewd, bright, heedful man

And plausible, and then excluding strangers

Concerted plans. Salm put their case in words,

Washed off all filial reverence from his eyes,

And thus addressed the envoy: " Hence away,

In spite of dust and tempest, swift as wind

To Faridun and heed not aught beside.

On reaching him greet him in both our names

And say : ' In heaven and earth the fear of G'od

Should equally prevail, the young may hope

To see old age, but hoar hairs turn not black.

By long abiding in this straitened place

Thou straitenest the long home for thyself.

All-holy God bestowed the world upon thee

From yonder bright sun unto sombre earth,

Yet didst thou choose to act in mere caprice,

Not heeding His commands, and to entreat

Thy sons with scath and fraud instead of justice;

For thou hadst three, wise, brave, and youths no longer,

And though no excellence appeared in one

So that the others should bow down to him,

Yet one thou blastedst with a dragon's breath,

Another's head thou raisedst to the clouds ;

On one thine eyes reposed with joy, and he

Now hath the crown and is beside thy couch,

While we who are as good as he by birth

Are deemed unworthy of the royal throne.

upright judge and monarch of the world !

May justice such as this be never blessed !

If then his worthless head shall be discrowned,

Earth rescued from his sway, and thou wilt give him

Some corner of the world where he may sit

Like us in anguish and oblivion — well :

Else will we bring the Turkman cavaliers

And eager warriors of Rum and Chm —

An army of the wielders of the mace —

In vengeance on Iran and on fraj.' "

The priest at this harsh message kissed the ground,

Then turned and mounted swift as wind-borne flame.

When he approached the court of Faridun

And marked the cloud-capt buildings from afar,

Which stretched from range to range, while at the gate

Chiefs sat and those of highest rank behind

The curtain, on the one side pards and lions

Chained, on the other fierce war-elephants,

While from that noble band of warriors

The noise that rose was like a lion's roar,

 " It must be heaven," he thought, " and not a court :

The troops around it are a fairy host !"

The wary watchman went and told the Shah :

> A man of noble mien and high estate
>
> Hath come as envoy to the Shah.

He bade

His servants raise the curtain and bring in

The envoy, when dismounted, to the court,

Who when he saw the face of Faridun,

Saw how the Shah engrossed all eyes and hearts,

His stature cypress-like, his face a sun,

His hair like camphor and his rose-red cheeks,

His smiling lips, his modest countenance,

And royal mouth, which uttered gracious words,

Did reverence and wore the ground with kisses.

The Shah commanded him to rise and sit

Upon the seat of honour due to him,

Then asked him first about the noble pair: —

"Enjoy they health and happiness ?" and next

About himself: "Art weary with long travel

O'er hill and plain ? "

He answered: "Noble Shah!

May none behold the world without thee ! Those

Of whom thou speakest are as thou wouldst wish,

And live but by thy name. Thy slave am I,

Albeit all unworthy and impure.

The message that I bring to thee is harsh

And sent in anger by no fault of mine,

But if my lord commandeth I will tell

The message sent by two imprudent youths."

The Shah commanded him to speak and heard

The embassage delivered word by word.
