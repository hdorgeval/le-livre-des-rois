# How Faridun sent Jandal to Yaman

Now fifty years had passed, and by good fortune

He had three noble sons fit for the crown,

Of royal birth, as tall as cypresses,

With cheeks like spring, in all points like their father.

Two were the stainless sons of Shahrinaz,

The youngest fair- cheeked Arnawaz had borne ;

And though they could outpace an elephant

Their father in his love had named them not.

In time the Shah perceived them fit to rule

And called Jandal, a noble counsellor,

In everything devoted to his lord,

And said :

> Go round the world, select three maidens
>
> Of noble lineage worthy of my sons,
>
> In beauty fit to be affined to me
>
> And named not by their sire for fear of talk,
>
> Three sisters in full blood with fairy faces,
>
> Unstained, of royal race, so much alike
>
> In height and looks that folk can scarce discern
>
> Betwixt them.

Having heard he undertook

The fair emprise, for he was shrewd and upright,

Of plausible address and full of tact.

He left Iran with certain of his friends

To make inquiries and receive reports.

Then when he heard of any chief with daughters

He sought to learn about them privily,

Yet could not find among the wealthy thanes

One fit to be affined to Farfdiin.

This shrewd and holy man at length reached Sarv —

The monarch of Yaman — with whom he found

The object of his search — three maidens such

As Faridun required. With stately step,

As 'twere a pheasant pacing toward a rose,

He came to Sarv, and having kissed the ground

Explained his coming, praised the king and said :

> For ever live, exalted sovereign,
>
> Thou ceaseless lustre, of the crown and throne !

The king said :

> Be thy praise in every mouth.
>
> What is thy message ? What are thy commands ?
>
> Art thou ambassador or principal ?

Jandal replied :

> May every joy be thine,
>
> And ever far from thee the hand of ill.
>
> I come as some poor heathen to convey
>
> A message from Iran. Great Faridun
>
> Saluteth thee by me. Thou ask'st my business:
>
> I answer : Mighty Faridun applaudeth thee,
>
> And great are they whom he despiseth not.
>
> He said : Say to the monarch of Yaman : —
>
> > So long as musk hath scent perfume the throne,
> >
> > Be thy griefs scattered and thy wealth amassed,
> >
> > And ever, king of Arabs ! mayst thou be
> >
> > Safeguarded by the stars from all mishap.
> >
> > What thing is there more sweet than life and children ?
> >
> > Yea, they are sweeter than all else beside,
> >
> > For none is dearer than a child, that bond
> >
> > Is as no other bond. If any man
> >
> > Hath three eyes I possess them in my sons,
> >
> > Bat know that they are better still than eyes
> >
> > For those that look on them give thanks. What said
> >
> > The sage when he defined a proper league ?
> >
> > > I ne'er ally myself but with my betters.
> >
> > A sage intent on good will seek his friends
> >
> > Among his peers, men may be fortunate
> >
> > But monarchs are not well without a host.
> >
> > My realm is prosperous, I have treasure, might,
> >
> > And daring, with three sons who well deserve
> >
> > To reign — wise, men of knowledge and of prowess,
> >
> > Without a want or wish unsatisfied.
> >
> > For these three princes in domestic life
> >
> > I need three consorts of a royal race,
> >
> > And I have news (whereon I send in haste)
> >
> > By means of mine informants that thou hast
> >
> > Among the ladies that are in thy bower,
> >
> > O honour-loving king ! three maiden daughters
> >
> > As yet unnamed, whereat my heart rejoiced,
> >
> > For my three sons of course are nameless still
> >
> > 'Twere surely well for us to intermingle
> >
> > These precious gems of two varieties,
> >
> > Three virtuous maids with three aspiring princes,
> >
> > Fit joined to fit, no room for scandal there.
>
> Such is his message ; think of thy reply.

The monarch of Yaman drooped like the jasmine

When out of water, thinking :

> If these Moons
>
> Are taken from me, and I see them not
>
> About my couch, my day will turn to night.
>
> No need to answer yet ; I will consult
>
> With those who share with me the consequence.

He first assigned the ambassador a lodging,

Then having closed the audience sat and pondered.

The monarch summoned from the Bedouins

Full many a chieftain well approved in war,

And made the matter manifest to all :

> I have as only issue of my wedlock
>
> Three Lights that are resplendent in mine eyes,
>
> And Faridun hath sent an embassage
>
> To spread a goodly snare before my feet ;
>
> He would deprive me of these Eyes of mine,
>
> And I would fain consult thereon with you.
>
> The ambassador saith thus : ' Thus saith the Shah : —
>
> > I have three princes who adorn my throne
> >
> > And seek for favour and affinity
> >
> > With thee by marriage with thy virtuous daughters.
>
> If I shall answer, ' Yes,' and mean it not,
>
> Twill be a lie ; to lie is not for kings ;
>
> If I shall acquiesce in his request
>
> My heart will be on fire, my face all tears ;
>
> And if I shall refuse my heart will feel
>
> His vengeance — not a matter for a jest
>
> From one who is the monarch of the world ;
>
> And travellers too have heard of what Zahhak
>
> Hath suffered from him. Now advise me well.

The veteran valiant chiefs thus made reply :

> We disapprove of veering to each gust.
>
> Be Faridun however great a king
>
> No earringed slaves are we, but say our say
>
> And take the consequence. Tis ours to handle
>
> The bridle and the lance ; we make the earth
>
> A winefat with our swords, we make the air
>
> A reed-bed with our spears. If thy three children
>
> Are held so dear unlock thy treasury
>
> And shut thy lips ; or, if thou wilt use craft,
>
> But fearest Faridun, make such demands
>
> That none shall ever hear the like again.

The king heard while the chieftains said their say,

But felt' no less uncertain of his way.
