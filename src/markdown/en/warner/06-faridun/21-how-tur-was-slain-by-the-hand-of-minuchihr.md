# How Tur was Slain by the Hand of Minuchihr

Noon passed. With vengeful hearts the brothers met

For consultation ; mid their foolish schemes

They said :

> Let us attempt a night-attack
>
> And fill the desert and the plain with blood.

That night those miscreants drew their army out,

Bent on a camisade. The franian scouts

Gat news thereof, and sped to Minuchihr

To tell him so that he might post his troops,

v. H2 That shrewd man heard and planned a counter-ruse.

He left Karan the host and led himself

An ambuscade with thirty thousand warriors,

All men of name. Tur came at night and brought

One hundred thousand men prepared for fight,

But found the foe arrayed with banners flying

And saw that battle was his sole resource.

A shout rose from the centres of the hosts,

The horsemen made the air a cloud of dust

And steel swords flashed like lightning: thou hadst said :

> They make air blaze, earth gleam like diamonds.

The clashing of the steel went through the brain,

While flame and blast rose cloudward. Minuchihr

Sprang from his ambush and surrounded Tur,

Who wheeled and fled mid wailings of despair

From his own troops. Prince Minuchihr pursued,

Hot for revenge, and cried :

> Stay, miscreant,
>
> Who lovest fight so well and cuttest off
>
> The heads of innocents I Know'st not that all
>
> Desire revenge on thee ?

He hurled a dart

Against Tur's back, whose sword fell from his grasp.

Then Minuchihr like wind unseated him,

Cast him to earth, slew him, cut off his head,

And left the body for the beasts of prey ;

Then went back to his camp to contemplate

That symbol of a fall from high estate.
