# How Minuchihr attacked the Host of Tur

v. 1 08 When the bright world grew dark and scouts dispersed

About the plain, Karan the warrior

And Sarv the counsellor, who led the host,

Observed :

> This will be Ahriman's own fight,
>
> A day of martial deeds and vengeance-seeking.

A proclamation issued to the troops :

> men of name and Lions of the Shah !
>
> FA RID UN
>
> Gird up your loins, be vigilant, and may
>
> The Almighty guard you. Whosoe'er is slain
>
> Will go to Paradise washed clean from sin ;
>
> While they who shed the blood of warriors
>
> Of Rum and Chin, and take their lands, shall have
>
> Eternal fame, the Grace of archimages;
>
> The Shah will give them thrones and diadems,
>
> Their chieftain gold and God prosperity.
>
> Now when the dawn is breaking and the sun
>
> Half risen gird upon your valiant loins
>
> Your maces and your daggers of Kabul,
>
> Take up your stations and preserve your ranks.

The captains of the host, the valiant chiefs,

Drew up before the lion-prince and said : â€”

"We are but slaves and live to serve the Shah,

Will do his will and with our swords make earth

Run like Jihiin."

They went back to their tents, v. 109

All purposing revenge.

Now when day broke,

Upheaving night's mid gloom, the prince assumed

His station at the centre of the host

With coat of armour, sword, and Rum an helm.

The soldiers shouted lifting to the clouds

Their spears. He duly ordered all the troops,

The left, the right, the centre, and the wings.

With heads all anger and with brows all frowns

They rolled up earth in marching. It resembled

A ship upon the waves and thou hadst said :

> It sinketh fast !

From his huge elephant

He dropped a ball, earth heaved like azure sea,

The drummers marched before the elephants

With roar and din like lions in their rage,

While from the sounds of pipe and clarion

Thou wouldst have said :

> It is a festival.

The troops moved mountain-like and both hosts shouted.

Anon the plain ran blood : thou wouldst have said

That tulips sprang up. Mighty elephants

Stood as on coral columns in the gore.

v. no They fought till night, till Minuchihr, who won

The love of all, obtained the victory ;

v. in Yet fortune in one stay abideth not,

Now honey and now gall make up man's lot.

The hearts of Tiir and Salm were deeply moved

By grief. They listened for a night-surprise,

But no one came e'en when night turned to day,

And they themselves were anxious for delay.
