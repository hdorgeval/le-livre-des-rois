# How Faridun ascended the Throne

When Faridun attained his wish, and reigned
Supreme on earth, he ordered crown and throne
According to the usance of old times
Within the palace of the king of kings ;
And on the first of Mihr, a blessed day,
Set on his head the royal diadem.

1 WPT, i. 119, 233-235.

2 For the subject-matter of the above cf. HEP, 277, 278 ; DZA, i.
225 ; MZA, iii. 233 ; WPT, ii. 369.

3 In the oldest Pahlavi — that of the inscriptions — the letters r and I
were represented by distinct signs, but in the later Pahlavi — that of
the manuscripts — the same sign stood for both letters ; it is easy to
understand the confusion that resulted, especially in the case of proper
names. See DEI, i. 19.

In those days, apprehensive of no evil,

All men began to tread the path of God,

Abstaining from contention and observing

A feast inaugurated royally.

Then sages sat rejoicing and each held

A ruby goblet, then the wine was bright,

The new Shah's face was bright and all the world

Itself was brightened as that month began.

He bade men kindle bonfires and the people v. 63

Burned ambergris and saffron ; thus he founded

Mihrgan. 1 That time of rest and festival

Began with him, and his memorial

Is still the month of Mihr. He banished then

All grief and labour from the minds of men.

He dedicated not a single day

To evil in five centuries of sway,

But yet the world remained not his. Then shun

Ambition and escape from grief, my son !

Note well that this world is no property,

And small contentment wilt thou gain thereby.

Now Faranak yet knew not that her child
Had come to be the Shah, or that Zahhak
Had lost the throne and that his power was ended.
At length news of the happy youth arrived
And of his being crowned. She bathed herself
And prostrate in God's presence offered thanks
Because of this most happy turn of fortune,
And uttered maledictions on Zahhak ;
Then to all those who were in poverty
And strove to hide it she afforded aid,
But kept alike their secret and her own.
She spent a week on alms till paupers failed ;
Another week she feasted all the nobles,
Bedecked her house as it had been a garden

1 A feast held on the 16th of Mihr and the five following days.

THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDA USl

And there received her guests. She then unlocked
The portal of her secret hoards, brought forth
The various treasures that she had amassed,
And purposed to distribute all her store.
It seemed the time to ope the treasury,
For drachms were trifles since her son was Shah.
She made no stint of robes and royal jewels,
Arabian steeds with headstalls wrought of gold,
v. 64 Habergeons, helmets, double-headed darts,

Swords, crowns and belts. Intent upon her son

She placed her wealth on camels and despatched it

With praises on her tongue. The king of earth

Beheld, accepted it, and blessed his mother.

The leaders of the army when apprised

Sped to the monarch of the world and cried : —

" Victorious Shah and worshipper of God,

To whom be praise ! may He give praise to thee.

Thus may thy fortune grow from day to day,

Thus may the fortunes of thy foes be shent,

May heaven make thee still victorious

And mayst thou still be gracious and august."

The wise came to the Shah from their retreats
And poured before his throne gold mixed with
gems ;

The nobles too from all his provinces

At that hocktide assembled at his gate,

Where all invoked God's blessing on the crown,

The throne, the diadem, and signet-ring.

With hands upstretched they prayed right heartily : —

" May such joy last, the Shah bear fruit for ever."

As time went on he journeyed round the world,
Examining its sights and mysteries,
Marked each injustice and all wasted lands,
Bound evil hands, with bonds of kindliness —
A policy that well beseemeth kings —

Bedecked the world like Paradise, and raised
Instead of grass the cypress and the rose-tree.
He reached Tammi'sha, passing by Amul, 1
And built a seat there in the famous chace :
Kiis is the modern title of the place.
