# How the Sons of Faridun went to the King of Yaman

They summoned archimages and made ready ;

Their retinue was like the starry sky,

All men of name with sunlike countenances.

Sarv, hearing of their coming, decked his host

Like pheasant's plumes, and sent to welcome them

A goodly band of kinsfolk and of magnates.

As those three noble princes reached Yaman

Both men and women met them on their way,

Bestrewing saffron mixed with precious jewels

And mingling musk with wine. The horses' manes

Were drenched therewith, and underneath their feet

Gold coins were flung. A palace was prepared

Like Paradise itself ; they overlaid

The bricks with gold and silver; all the hangings

Were of brocade of Rum â€” a mass of wealth.

There Sarv disposed his guests and by the morn

Had put them at their ease. He brought his daughters,

As Faridun had said, out of their bowers,

Like shining moons too dazzling for the eye,

And ranged them just as Farfdiin foretold.

Sarv asked the eldest prince :

> Which is the youngest
>
> Of these three Stars, which is the mid in age,
>
> And which the eldest ? Thus distinguish them.

They answered as they had been taught, and so

Sewed up the eyelids of his craft, while he

And all his warriors were lost in wonder.

He saw that his inversion naught availed

And answered, " Yea," and paired the pairs aright.

The introduction ended in betrothal.

The three princesses, blushing for their father,

Went from the presence of the three young princes

In sweet confusion, blushes on their cheek

And many a word of tenderness to speak.
