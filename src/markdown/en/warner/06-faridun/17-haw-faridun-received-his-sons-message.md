# Haw Faridun received his Sons' Message

Charged with these words, and doubting what would

follow,

The envoy reached the portal of the Shah

With treasures of all kinds on elephants.

o

2IO

When Faridun was told he gave command

To spread brocade of Rum upon the throne

Of king of kings and have the royal crown

Prepared, then took his seat as he had been

An upright cypress 'neath a full-orbed moon

In fitting state with crown and torque and ear-

rings.

Blest Minuchihr sat by him crowned, the nobles

Stood ranked in double file in robes of gold,

With golden mace and girdle, making earth

Another sun. On one side pards and lions

Were chained, on the other huge war-elephants.

Then from the palace issued bold Shapur

To introduce Salm's envoy, who on seeing

The palace-gate alighted and ran forward,

v. 99 As soon as he drew near to Faridun

And saw the diadem and lofty throne,

He bent until his visage touched the ground.

The noble Shah, the monarch of the world,

Bade him be seated on a golden seat.

He did obeisance to the Shah and said :

> glory of the crown and throne and signet !
>
> Thy throne's steps make the earth a rosary,
>
> And thy fair fortune brighteneth the age.
>
> We serve the dust that is beneath thy feet
>
> And only live since thou wilt have it so.

These praises caused the Shah's face to relax,

Whereat the envoy spake of clemency

With great craft, and the Shah gave ear to him

While he repeated those two murderers' words,

Endeavouring to keep the truth concealed

And make excuses for their wickedness,

Inviting Minuchihr to visit them

When they would wait upon him as his slaves,

Give him the crown and throne of majesty

And purchase back from him fraj's blood

With wealth, brocade, di'n&amp;rs, and jewelry.

The monarch heard the speech and answered it ;

Like key to lock so did the answer fit.
