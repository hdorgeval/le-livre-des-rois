# How Iraj was Slain by his Brothers

Now when the veil was lifted from the sun,
As morning dawned and slumber passed away,
The hearts of that insensate parr were eager
To do their deed of shame ; they proudly strode
Toward their royal brother's tent. Iraj,
Who saw them coming, met them tenderly.

THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDA USt

v. 8j They went with him inside the tent. The talk
Ran on the why and wherefore of his coming.
Tiir said to him : " Since thou art youngest born
Why shouldst thou take the crown of power? Must
thou

Possess the throne of princes and Iran

While I am bondslave at the Turkman's gate ?

Thine eldest brother chafeth in the West

While thou art crowned and walkest over treasure,

For thus did our aspiring sire apportion

The world in favour of his youngest son."

Iraj made answer in a holier strain : —
" mighty chieftain, lover of renown !
Seek peace if thou wouldst have thy heart at ease.
I do not want the royal crown or throne,
The style of monarch or the franian host ;
I do not want fran, the West, or Chin,
The kingship or the broad expanse of earth.
When majesty produceth naught but strife
One needs must weep o'er such supremacy.
Although thou ridest on the heaven above,
l A brick will be thy pillow in the end.
For my part, though the master of Iran,
I am aweary both of crown and throne,
And yield to you the diadem and signet,
So hate me not; there is no feud between us,
No heart need ache through me. I will not have
The world against your will, and though I dwell
Far from your ken I ever act as younger :
My Faith is naught without humanity."

Tiir heard the words and little heeded them,
But, angry that fraj should speak and caring
No jot for peace, he rose up with a cry
And then advancing suddenly, and grasping
The massive seat of gold, he smote Iraj,

Who pleaded for his life : " Hast thou no fear
Of God, nor any reverence for thy sire ?
Is this indeed thy purpose ? Slay me not,
For in the end my blood will be required.
Be not thou reckoned with the murderers,
And henceforth thou shalt find no trace of me.
Canst thou approve and reconcile these twain —
To be a murderer and live thyself ?
Oh ! hurt not e'en the poor grain-dragging ant,
For it hath life, and sweet life is a joy. 1 ^
I will choose some retreat and earn my bread ;
Why gird thy loins to take a brother's life ?
Why set on fire our aged father's heart ?
Wouldst have the world ? Thou hast it. Shed not
blood :

Provoke not God, the Ruler of the world."

Tiir heard him speak but answered not a word :
His heart was full, his head was vapouring.
He drew a dagger from his boot, he robed
Iraj in blood, and with the keen bright blade
Entrenched the royal breast. The lofty Cypress
Fell, the imperial girdlestead was broken,
The blood ran down that face of cercis-bloom,
And thus the young illustrious monarch died !
Tur with his dagger cut the prince's head
From the elephantine form and all was over.

world ! since thou hadst nursed him tenderly
Yet didst not spare his life at last, I wis

Not who thy secret favourites may be,
But needs must weep for such an act as this. \_

ancient Zoroastrian custom of killing ants at sight as being the crea
tion of Ahriman. "The celebrated high-priest of the Parsis, the latt
Moola Firooz, entered these lines into his Pand Namah,\* which maj
betoken better days for the wise little creature." DZA, i. 171.

THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDA USI

Thou too, man distracted and distraught,
Whose heart the world hath seared and caused to bleed !

If, as with these, revenge is in thy thought
, Take warning by these persecutors deed.

They filled the head with inusk and ambergris
And sent it to the aged world-divider
v. 91 With these words : " Look upon thy darling's head —
The inheritor of our forefathers' crown —
And give it crown or throne as pleaseth thee."

The royal and far-shadowing Tree had fallen,
And those two miscreants went their way in spleen,
One unto Rum, the other unto Chin.
