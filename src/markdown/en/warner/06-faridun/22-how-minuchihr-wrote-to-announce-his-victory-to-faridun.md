# How Minuchihr wrote to Announce his Victory to Faridun

Then Minuchihr wrote to SMh Faridun

About the war — its fortunes good and ill —

And first he spake of Him who made the world —

The Lord of goodness, purity, and justice :

> Pr&amp;ise to the Worldlord who hath succoured us !
>
> Men find no other helper in their straits.
>
> He is the Guide, he maketh hearts rejoice
>
> And changeth not throughout eternity.
>
> Next, praises be to noble Faridun —
>
> The lord of crown and mace, possessed of justice,
>
> The Faith and Grace, crown and imperial throne.
>
> His fortune is the source of righteousness,
>
> His throne of beauty and of excellence.
>
> By virtue of thy Grace I reached Turan,
>
> Arrayed the host and fought by day and night
>
> Thrice fiercely in two days. I heard that Tiir
>
> Designed a night-attack and wanting power
>
> Relied on craft ; so I arranged an ambush
>
> And left him nothing but the wind to clutch.
>
> He fled, I followed, and o'ertaking him
>
> Pierced through his armour with a javelin,
>
> And took him from his saddle like the wind.
>
> I flung him as I would a serpent down
>
> And from his worthless body smote the head,
>
> Which lo ! I send my grandsire, and forthwith
>
> Will set about a stratagem for Salm.
>
> Since Tur had placed within a golden casket
>
> His royal brother's head in foul contempt,
>
> And had no ruth or reverence for him, God,
>
> Who made the world, delivered Tur to me,
>
> And I have slain him as he slew Iraj ;
>
> And will lay waste his realm and dwelling-place.

The letter done he sent a cameleer,

Who sped like wind with cheeks suffused with shame

And hot tears in his eyes for Faridun ;

How should he like to be the carrier

Of Tiir's head to the monarch of Iran ?

Though dead sons were perverse their fathers mourn them;

But as the crime was great and unprovoked,

And as the avenger was both young and brave,

The messenger approached with confidence

And laid the head of Tur before the Shah,

Who prayed to God, the righteous Judge, to pour

On Minuchihr his blessings evermore.
