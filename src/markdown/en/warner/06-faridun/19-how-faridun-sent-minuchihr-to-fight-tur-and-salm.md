# How Faridun sent Minuchihr to fight Tur and Salm

The Shah was told, "A host hath crossed Jihun,"

And bade prince Minuchihr to pass the frontier

2l6

v. 105 Toward the desert, thus advising him :

> A youth predestined to be fortunate
>
> May happen to ensnare a mountain-sheep
>
> While hunters are before and pards behind ;
>
> But having patience, prudence, sense, and wits,
>
> He will take savage lions in his toils,
>
> And now my foes in these my closing days
>
> I would chastise, and wield a sword of fire.
>
> > Great Shah I

said Minuchihr, " may fate keep ill

For any foe that cometh to attack thee ;

May he betray himself both soul and body.

Lo ! I will don a coat of Human mail

To leave no part exposed, and then in quest

Of vengeance on the battlefield will send

The dust of yon host sunward. None of them

Hold I a man : dare they contend with me ?"

He ordered that Karan, who loved the fray,

Should cross the frontier to the desert, taking

The camp-enclosure and the imperial standard.

Then as troop followed troop the hills and plains

Heaved like the sea, the day was dark with dust,

And thou hadst said :

> The sun is azure-dim.

A clamour rose enough to deafen ears

Though keen, the neighing of the Arab steeds

Rose high above the tymbals' din. Two lines

Of mighty elephants stretched from the camp

For two miles, sixty carried seats of gold

Inlaid with gems, three hundred bore the baggage,

v. 106 Three hundred were in iron panoply

That hid all but their eyes.

They left Tammfsha

And bore the camp-enclosure to the waste.

Karan the avenger was the general,

The host three hundred thousand cavaliers.

The men of name marched mailed, with massive maces,

FARIDUN

All bold as angry lions and all girded

For vengeance for Iraj ; their steel-blue swords

Were in their hands and Kawa's standard led them.

Then Minuchihr with him who loved the fray,

Karan, went from the forest of Narwan,

Reviewed and ranged his host on those broad plains.

He gave the army's left wing to Garshasp ;

Upon the right was brave Sam with Kubad,

Who set the battle in array. The prince

With Sarv was in the centre, whence he shone

Moon-like, or as the sun o'er some high hill.

Led by Karan, with champions such as Sam,

The Iranian army fought. Kubad was scout,

The heroes of the house of Taliman

Were ambuscaders, and the host was decked

In bridal trim with lion-warriors

And din of drums.

Men bore the news in haste

To Tur and Salm :

> The Iranians armed for fight
>
> Are marching toward the desert from the forest,
>
> Their livers 1 blood afoam upon their lips.

That pair of murderers with a huge array

Set forth intent on vengeance and drew up

Their host upon the plain : they made the Alans

And sea their base. Kubad the scout advanced,

And Tur on hearing that came forth like wind,

And said to him :

> Return to Minuchihr
>
> And say to him : ' Thou bastard just made Shah !
>
> What though there was a daughter to Iraj, v. 107
>
> Hast thou a right to signet, crown, and throne ? '

" Yea, I will take thy message," said Kubad,

> In thine own words and style, but thou wilt quake
>
> To think hereafter of this monstrous speech.
>
> 'Twill not be strange if even savage beasts
>
> 1 Reading with C.
>
> 2 Cf. DEI, ii. 217.
>
> THE SHAH NAM A OF FlRDAUSt
>
> Bewail you day and night, for from Narwan
>
> To Chin are warlike, vengeful cavaliers.
>
> A glimpse of our bright swords and Kawa's standard
>
> Will make your hearts and brains burst in dismay :
>
> Ye will not know a valley from a hill.

Tur heard and turned away in silent dudgeon,

While blest Kubad went back to Minuchihr

And told the insulting words. The young prince laughed.

> None but a fool,

he said,

> would talk like this.
>
> But praise to Him — the Lord of both the worlds —
>
> Who knoweth all things secret or revealed !
>
> He knoweth that my grandsire was fraj,
>
> As blessed Faridun assureth me,
>
> But when I show my person in the fight
>
> My birth and prowess will approve themselves.
>
> Now by the Grace of Him who ruleth sun
>
> And moon I will not leave Tur power to wink,
>
> But show his trunkless head to all the host ;
>
> I will avenge my blessed sire upon him
>
> And turn his kingdom upside down.

He ceased

And issued orders to prepare a feast.
