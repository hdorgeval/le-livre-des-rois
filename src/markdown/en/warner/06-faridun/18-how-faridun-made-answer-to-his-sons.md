# How Faridun made Answer to his Sons

The Shah, when he had heard the message sent

By his two wicked sons, said to the envoy : —

" Canst thou conceal the sun, and clearer still

Are shown the secrets of those miscreants' hearts ?

I have heard all thy words ; now mark mine answer.

Tell those two shameless and unholy men,

Unrighteous, ill-affectioned, and impure,

That their vain words avail them not, and I

Have also something that I fain would say : —

' If thus your love for Minuchihr hath grown

Where is the body of his famous sire —

fraj ? The maw of wild beasts hideth it.

His head is in a narrow casket laid,

And they who made a riddance of Iraj

Now seek to shed the blood of Minuchihr !

Ye shall not see his face but with an army

And with a casque of steel upon his head,

With mace and Kawian standard while the earth

Is darkened by his horses' trampling hoofs ;

With leaders like K&amp;ran, who loveth fight,

Shapur — the valiant backbone of the host —

And by his side Shi'dush the warrior,

Shfrwi the lion-strong as pioneer,

King Tah'man, and Sarv, king of Yaman,

To head the forces and direct the war ;

And we will drench with blood, both leaf and fruit,

The tree sprung out of vengeance for Iraj.

THE SHAH NAM A OF FJRDA USI

No one hath sought revenge for him as yet
Because I saw the back of fortune bent :
It seemed not good to me to lay my hands
In battle on mine own two sons ; but now
From that same Tree which enemies have felled
A fruitful Offshoot hath sprung up ; for like
An angry lion Mimichihr shall come,
With loins girt ready to avenge his sire,
Together with the leaders of the troops —
Such chiefs as Sam the son of Nariman,
Garshasp, son of Jamshid — and hosts to reach
From hill to hill, and trample down the world/
Next for their pleading that the Shah must wash
His heart from vengeance, and forgive our crime,
Because the sky so turned o'er us that wisdom
Was troubled, and affection's seat obscured :
I have heard all the unavailing plea,
And now that patience is fordone I answer : —
No man that soweth seed of violence
Shall see good days or jocund Paradise,
If ye are pardoned by All-holy God

What need ye fear about a brother's blood ?
The wise esteem the self-excuser guilty.
Revere ye not the glorious Lord of all ?
Your hearts are black, your tongues speak glozing words ;

He will requite you for it in both worlds.
And thirdly, since ye sent an ivory throne
And torquoise crown on mighty elephants,
With purses full of divers-coloured gems,
Am I to balk revenge, to wash away
The blood and sell the prince's head for gold ?
Nay ! perish first throne, diadem, and Grace !
Worse than a dragon's offspring is the man
Who taketh money for a priceless head.

Shall any say : ' The sire in his old age
Is putting price upon his son's dear life ? '
As for these gifts of yours — I need them not.
But wherefore utter I so many words ?
Your hoary-headed sire will not ungird
The loins of his revenge while life endureth.
Thy message have I heard. Hear my reply,
Retain it every whit and get thee gone."

The messenger grew pale at this dread speech
And at the bearing of prince Minuchihr,
Leapt up in fear and mounted instantly.
The noble, youthful envoy shrewdly saw : —
" Revolving heaven in no long time will furrow
The visages of Tiir and Salm."

He sped

Like rushing wind, his head full of the message,

His heart of bodings. When he saw the West,

With camp-enclosures stretched upon the plain,

He made his way toward Salm's pavilion

Of painted silk with other tents around, v. 102

Where sat both kings in conclave. Word was passed : —

" The envoy hath returned."

The chamberlain
Approached and took him to the royal presence.
They had a special seat prepared for him
And asked for tidings of the new-made Shah,
Of crown and throne and of Shah Faridiin,
His host, his warriors, and his dominions,
And of the aspect of the turning sky : —
" What favour showeth it to Minuchihr ?
Who are the nobles ? Who is minister ?
What treasures have they ? Who hath charge
thereof?"

The envoy said : " The portal of the Shah
Beholdeth that which bright spring seeth not,

THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDA USi

For 'tis the jocund Spring of Paradise
Where ground is ambergris and bricks are gold.
The roof above his palace is a heaven,
And Paradise is in his smiling face.
When I approached his lofty residence
Its roof was telling secrets to the stars.
On this hand there were lions, and on that
Were elephants. The world itself was placed
Beneath his throne. Upon his elephants
Were seats of gold, and round the lions' necks
Were jewelled torques. The tymbal-players stood
Before the elephants while trumpets blared.
Thou wouldst have said : ' The precincts seethe, earth shouteth

To heaven/ I came before that well-loved Shah,
And saw a lofty turquoise throne where sat
v. 103 A monarch like a moon. Upon his head
He wore a sparkling ruby coronet.
His hair was white as camphor, and his cheeks
Were like the petals of the rose. His heart
Is full of clemency, his speech is kind ;
He is the hope and fear of all the world.
Thou wouldst have said : ' Jamshid doth live again/
A Shoot from that tall Cypress — Minuchihr,
Like Tahmuras, the Binder of the Dlv,
Sat on the Shah's right hand : thou wouldst have said : —
' He is the heart and soul of that great Shah/
There Kawa stood, the skilled among the smiths,
With one before him well beseen in war —
His son, Karan by name, the warrior,
The watchful chief, the conqueror of hosts ;
The minister — Sarv, monarch of Yaman,
The treasurer — victorious Garshasp,
Were there. The sum within the treasuries
Appeareth not. None ever saw such greatness.

FARIDUN

Around the palace were two lines of troops
With golden maces and with golden helms.
Before them there were leaders like Karan,
The son of Kawa, that experienced captain,
And warriors — ravening Lions like Shirwi,
And bold Shapur, the elephantine chief.
When on the elephants they bind the drums
The air becometh ebon with the dust.
If these men come to fight us hill and plain
Will be confounded ; these men have revenge
At heart ; their faces frown ; they purpose war."

The envoy having further told the message
Of Farfdun, those tyrants' hearts grew sore,
Their faces blue as lapislazuli.
They sat consulting, but had naught determined
When Tur spake thus : " Farewell to peace and joy !
We must not let this hardy lion's whelp
Grow bold and sharp of fang. Will such a youth
Lack prowess, being taught by Faridun ?
When grandson communeth with grandsire thus
Some devilry is sure to come of it.
Prepare we then for war and that with speed."

They hurried out their cavalry and mustered
Troops from the West and Chin, whence hubbub rose
And all flocked to the kings — a multitude
Whose star of fortune was no longer young.
Two hosts empanoplied marched on fran
With mighty elephants, much precious store,
And those two murderers intent on war.
