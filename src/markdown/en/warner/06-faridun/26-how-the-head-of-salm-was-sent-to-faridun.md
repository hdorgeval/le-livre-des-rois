# How the Head of Salm was sent to Faridun

The hero called a courier, gave to him
The head of Salm, the monarch of the West,
And wrote to tell his grandsire of the fight
And strategy, first giving God the praise

2 SO

THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDA USI

And then the Sh&amp;h : " Praise to the conquering World-
lord

From whom are virtue, power, and Grace ! His blessing
Is now on Faridun, that wise, brave Shah,
Who hath released us from the bonds of ill,
And hath the wisdom and the Grace of God.
We are avenged upon the cavaliers
Of Chin. We lay in ambush for their lives.
Strong in the Shah with our avenging scimitars
We smote the heads off those unrighteous men,
v. 125 Who both were reeking with t raj's blood ;

We purged the surface of the earth with steel.
Lo ! I am coming like the wind behind
My letter, and will tell thee all that passed."

He sent Shi'rwi, the aspiring veteran,
Back to the hold, and said : " Explore the booty,
Act as thou seest best, and take the Shah
The spoil upon high-crested elephants."

He bade the drummers and the pipers fare
Forth from the royal tent, and from that hold
In Chm marched inland back to Faridun.
As he approached Tammisha on his way
His grandsire longed to look at him. The blast
Of clarions ascended from the gate,
The host began to march out. Faridun,
That man of wakeful fortune, decked the backs
Of all the elephants with turquoise thrones,
And golden litters with brocade and gems.
A world of banners, yellow, red, and blue,
Waved overhead. The host marched toward Sari,
Like black clouds from the waters of Gilan,
With golden bridles and with golden girdles,
With silvern stirrups and with golden bucklers,
With treasures, elephants, and precious stores,
In readiness to welcome Minuchihr.

FARIDifN

231

Now as that prince approached the royal host

His grandsire went afoot to welcome him,

As did the men of Gil like lions loose,

With torques of gold and helmets black as musk.

The Iranians followed on behind the Shah, v. 126

Each like a savage lion, troops went first,

The elephants and lions in the midst,

Behind the elephants more valiant troops.

Whenas the flag of Faridiin appeared

The host of Mimichihr deployed in line.

That youthful prince, that sapling just producing

Its earliest fruits, dismounted from his steed.

He kissed the ground and blessed the monarch's throne,

His diadem and crown and signet-ring,

But Faridiin commanded him to mount,

Kissed him and grasped his hand.

Then Faridiin
Returning home sent word to Sam, the son
Of Nariman : " Come presently," for Sam
Had come from Hindustan to help to fight
Against the sorcerers, and brought withal
A mighty store of gold and precious things
Above whate'er the Shah required of him —
Such myriads of jewels and dinars
That no accountant could have reckoned them.
Sam, when he reached the monarch of the world,
Saluted both the old Shah and the young.
The famous monarch seated Sam beside him,
The great king seated the great paladin,
And said : " I put my grandsire in thy charge,
For I must now depart. Help him in all
And make him show a prowess like thine own."

The great Shah lightly laid the young man's hand
In that world-paladin's, looked up and said : —
" Almighty God I Just Judge who sayest sooth !

232 THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDA USI

v. 127 Thou saidst: 'I am the Almighty, the just Judge,
The Help of the oppressed in their distress/
Right hast Thou done me, Thou hast holpen me
And given me both crown and signet-ring.
God ! Thou hast granted me my whole desire ;
Now take me to the other world — a better
Than this — because I would not that my soul
Should tarry longer in this narrow sphere."

Shirwl the chieftain with the spoils approached
The palace of the Shah, who lavished all
The booty on the troops.

He gave directions,
Two days ere Mihr, for Minuchihr to sit
Helmed on the throne of gold, with his own hands
Crowned the young prince, and gave his last commands.
