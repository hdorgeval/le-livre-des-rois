# How Salm fled and was Slain by the Hand of Minuchihr

Kakwi being dead, the master of the West,

Whose stay was broken, ceased to seek revenge

And sought to gain his stronghold in his flight,

But when he reached the sea saw not a spar

Of any vessel there. The franian host,

Though clogged by killed and wounded on the plain,

Pursued apace, while Minuchihr, all wrath

And vengeance, cast his fleet white charger's mail

And pressed on till within the foemen's dust

And hard upon the king of Rum he cried : —

THE SHAHNA.MA OF FIRDA USt

" Thou who art guilty of the blackest crime,
v. 122 Who murderedst thy brother for his crown !

Hast thou obtained it ? Whither wilt thou flee ?
I bring thee now, king ! a crown and throne :
The royal Tree hath come to bearing fruit.
Fly not the throne of greatness ! Faridun
Hath got a new throne ready for thine use.
The tree which thou hast planted beareth now,
And thy breast shall receive the produce of it ;
If thorns, the tree was planted by thyself ;
If painted silk, the weaving was thine own."

As thus he spake he urged his steed along
And in another moment overtook
And clave the king asunder from the neck,
Then bade the head be set upon a spear,
While all admired his might and warlike arm.

Salm's troops were scattered like a flock by snow
And wandered aimlessly in companies
Amid the wastes, the caverns, and the hills.
They bade one wary, wise, and eloquent
To go to Mimichihr forthwith and say
On their behalf: " We are thy subjects all
And only tread the earth to do thy will.
Among us there are some possessed of herds,
And some of tilth and palaces. To fight
Was not our interest but our king's command;
We came as soldiers, not to seek revenge.
We are the Shah's slaves now and bow our heads
To do his will and pleasure. If he willeth
v. 123 Revenge and bloodshed we can but submit.
We all are guiltless and we all come in,
So let him do as seemeth good to him,
For he is master of our guiltless lives."

Thus spake the sage, the chief in wonder answered : —
(i I cast my passions and exalt my name.

FARIDJJfN 229

What is not God's is Ahriman's and evil ;

Be all such banished from my sight, and may

The divs be punished for their sins. Ye all

Are either foes or friends and mine allies,

But innocent and guilty both are spared

Since God hath given us victory. 'Tis the day

Of justice, wrong hath ceased, the leaders' heads

Are safe from fallinsr now. Seek brotherhood

And use it for a charm, put off from you

The implements of war, be wise and pure

In Faith, secure from ill, and banish vengeance.

Now in your dwellings wheresoe'er they be,

In Chin, Turan, or in the land of Rum,

Let all the virtues form your pedestal

And be your homes those of enlightened minds."

The great chiefs praised that noble, upright prince,
And proclamation issued from his tent : —
" Ye paladins whose counsel prospereth !
Shed no more needless blood, the tyrants' fortunes
Are overthrown."

Then all the troops of Chin V. 124

Fell prostrate, brought their arms and gear of war
To Minuchihr, and as they passed him piled
A mountain of horse-armour, helms, and breastplates,
Of maces and of Indian scimitars,
While Minuchihr the chieftain graciously
Entreated each one as his rank might be.
