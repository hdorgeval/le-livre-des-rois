# Tahmuras ascends the Throne, invents new Arts, subdues the Divs, and dies

Hushang possessed a wise and noble son

Hight Tahmuras — the Binder of the Di'v —

Who took the throne and girt his loins to rule,

Then called the archmages and in gracious words

Said :

> Throne and palace, crown and mace and cap
>
> Are mine to-day, and when my rede hath purged
>
> The world a mountain-top shall.be my footstool.
>
> I will restrain the Di'v, will reign supreme,
>
> And use the useful for the common gold.

He sheared the flocks, and men began to spin ;

He thus invented clothes and draperies.

He chose the swiftest quadrupeds and made them

To feed on barley, grass, and hay ; he noted

v 21 The shyest of the beasts of prey, and chose

The jackal and the cheetah, luring them

From hill and plain, and taught them to obey him.

Among the well-armed birds he chose the hawk

And noble falcon, and began to tame them

\ While men looked on amazed. His orders were

To rear the birds and speak to them with kindness.

He brought the cocks and hens to crow at drumbeat, 2

And turned all hidden properties to use.

He said :

> Address your prayers and praise to Him
>
> Who made the world, and us to rule the beasts :
>
> Praise be to Him, for He directed us.

1 See Introd. p. 48.

2 The drum beaten outside palaces in the East at dawn.

He had a famed and honest minister

By name Shi'dasp, an upright man who took

No step unless toward justice. Through the day

He fasted, through the night he prayed, and lived

In charity with all. The Shah's good fortune

Was his sole wealth, ill doers he restrained

And taught the Shah all good, acknowledging

No rank but excellence till Tahmuras,

Purged of his faults and glorious with the Grace,

Bound Ahriman with spells and rode him horsewise

At whiles around the world. Thereat the dfvs

Rebelled and held a conclave, for their throne

Of gold was void. When Tahmuras was ware v. 22

He was enraged and spoiled their trafficking,

Girt him with Grace and took his massive mace.

Then all the dfvs and warlocks sallied forth —

A huge magician host. The Black Div led them

And vapoured, while their shouts affronted heaven.

It darkened, earth turned sable and all eyes

Grew dim. The illustrious worldlord Tahmuras |

Advanced girt up for battle and revenge.

There were the roar of flame and reek of divs,

Here were the warriors of the lord of earth,

Who ranked his troops and speedily prevailed,

For of the foe he bound the most by spells

And quelled the others with his massive mace.

The captives bound and stricken begged their lives.

> Destroy us not,

they said,

> and we will teach thee
>
> A new and frui tful art.

He gave them quarter

To learn their secret. When they were released

They had to serve him, lit his mind with knowledge

And taught him how to write some thirty scripts

Such as the Rurnan, Persian, Arabic,

Sughdi, Chmf, and Pahlavi, and thus

Delineate sounds. How many better arts

Explored he in a reign of thirty years,

Yet passed away ! His time of life was spent

And all his toils became his monument.

O world ! caress not those whom thou wilt soon

Cut off, for such caressing is no boon ;

Thou raisest one to very heaven on high,

Then biddest him in sorry dust to lie.
