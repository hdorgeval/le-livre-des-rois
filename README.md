## The mythic history of Persian Kings by Ferdowsi

It took more than 30 years and more than 100,000 verses for the Persian poet Ferdowsi to write the Book of Kings.

This book is mainly the mythical and to some extent the historical past of the Persian Empire from the creation of the world until the Muslim conquest in the seventh century.

This repo is intended to :

- hold Ferdowsi's work in Markdown format in all available languages used to translate this book;

- bring a framework that enables to automatically build a website from these Markdown assets.

I started with the French language, any contributor for other languages is welcomed.

You can read the book in French at https://www.lelivredesrois.com
