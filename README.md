## The mythic history of Persian Kings by Ferdowsi

It took more than 30 years and more than 100,000 verses for the Persian poet Ferdowsi to write the Book of Kings.

This book is mainly the mythical and to some extent the historical past of the Persian Empire from the creation of the world until the Muslim conquest in the seventh century.

This repo is intended to :

- hold Ferdowsi's work in Markdown format in all available languages used to translate this book;

- hold any related work in Markdown format, like for example the Zend-Avesta;

- bring a framework to automatically build any kind of digital assets from these Markdown data sources;

- bring innovative tools, like machine learning, geo-data discovery, to be able to manage and study this new corpus of data in a multi-dimensional way: by time, by content, by geography, by characters, by language.

I started with the French translation of the `Shâhnâmeh` brought by `Jules Mohl` in 1876 after he started it in 1826. You can follow up the digitalisation process in the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) and in the [stats page](./stats/fr/stats.fr.md) for the French version.

Any contributor for other languages is welcomed.

As you imagine, translating `Jules Mohl`'s work into Markdown is a huge task: it's not a matter of weeks but a matter of years to achieve this. The key success factor is to bring automation and machine learning wherever possible.
