## The mythic history of Persian Kings by Ferdowsi

It took more than 30 years and more than 100,000 verses for the Persian poet Ferdowsi to write the Book of Kings.

This book is mainly the mythical and to some extent the historical past of the Persian Empire from the creation of the world until the Muslim conquest in the seventh century.

This repo is intended to :

- hold Ferdowsi's work in Markdown format in all available languages used to translate this book;

- bring a framework that enables to automatically build a website from these Markdown assets;

- bring innovative tools, like machine learning, to be able to manage and study this new corpus of data.

I started with the French translation of the `Shâhnâmeh` brought by `Jules Mohl` in 1876 after he started it in 1826.

Any contributor for other languages is welcomed.

As you imagine, translating `Jules Mohl`'s work into Markdown is a huge task: it's not a matter of weeks but a matter of years to achieve this. The key success factor is to bring automation and machine learning wherever possible.

You can read the book in French at https://www.lelivredesrois.com
